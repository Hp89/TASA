"Rahul Gandhi: Rahul targets PM Modi over alleged data-sharing by NaMo app, BJP hits back | India News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was supplying to American companies data on Indians who had signed up for his NAMO appù, continuing his attack on the saffron camp since the Centre accused him of engaging controversial data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica a charge categorically denied by the opposition party. NEW DELHI: President on Sunday alleged that Prime Minister was supplying to American companies data on Indians who had signed up for his NAMO appù, continuing his attack on the saffron camp since the Centre accused him of engaging controversial data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica a charge categorically denied by the opposition party.  Setting off another round of political sparring, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am Indias PM. When you sign up for my official app, I give all your data to my friends in American companies.     The tweet tagged a web report which stated that a French cyber expert has claimed that personal data of subscribers to Namo apa was automatically sent to a third-party domain without consent. Rahul has been tweeting incessantly since law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged at a press conference that Congress had engaged controversial data mining firm CA. Prasad cited media reports to ask Congress if it would manipulate data to win the 2019 polls. The CA is at the centre of a storm for illegally harvesting Facebook data.  While Congress roundly dismissed the allegations and asserted it had never hired the services of CA, Rahul called Prasad‚Äôs allegations as a ploy to divert popular attention from death of 39 Indians in Iraq which triggered off biting criticism of the government.  The row took a new turn when the India partner of CA alleged that the company may have tried to ‚Äúinfiltrate and sabotage‚Äù Congress in 2012. Rahul alleged the Congress-CA links were ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù by BJP to bury the revelation. An angry AICC chief accused minister Prasad of lying for PM Modi as Goebbels did for Hitler.    In a series of tweets, BJP countered Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs twitter jibe at , saying it shows that the Congress President and his party colleagues have ‚Äúzero knowledge‚Äù of technology and even accused the opposition party of taking help of data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica for electoral contests.     Party said that Gandhi is no match for Narendra Modi and his fright about the NaMo app is very amusing. ‚ÄúWhen his bots tried to trend #DeleteNamoApp day before yesterday (Friday), the popularity and downloads of NaMo app only increased. Today, it will be no different!‚Äù  ‚ÄúAll they can do is scare the masses about technology while they continue to steal data using his ‚ÄòBrahmastra‚Äô of Cambridge Analytica,‚Äù the party said, reiterating its allegations that Congress used stolen data from Facebook during the recent polls.  Responding to the charges that NaMo app was sharing users‚Äô data, the party said contrary to Gandhi‚Äôs lies, data are being used for only analytics, using third party service, similar to Google Analytics. ‚ÄúAnalytics on the user data is done for offering users the most contextual content,‚Äù it said.     BJP clarified that this ensures that a user gets the best experience by showing content in his language and interests. ‚ÄúA person who looks up agri-related info will get agri-related content easily. A person from TN will get updates in Tamil and get an update about an important initiative about TN.‚Äù  BJP also highlighted Rahul‚Äôs candid admission during an interaction in Karnataka that he was unaware of NCC. ‚ÄúRahul Gandhi is in sublime form these days. After MRI & NCC, today he exposes his great knowledge about technology. He is so rattled by the Cambridge Analyitca expose that he daily tries to divert attention from it, yesterday (Saturday) it was the judiciary and today (Sunday) it is Namo App,‚Äù BJP said. BJP said Rahul should download the NaMo App to keep himself abreast with the good things happening in India.     Be the first one to review. We have sent you a verification email.

"Rahul technologically illiterate, says BJP; Congress calls the govt ‚Äòdata leak sarkar‚Äô | India News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," NEW DELHI: As the Congress party today accused the BJP of stealing people's private information, the latter responded by calling the Congress president Rahul Gandhi ""technologically illiterate"".  BJP was reacting to Congress president's charges accusing the Modi government of stealing users' data shared on the , 'NaMo'.  ""Rahul's allegations are a classic case of technological illiteracy. He does not know that data analysis is not equivalent to spying. This new age is the age of information which Rahul ji will not understand,"" BJP spokesperson said in a press conference.    Prior to Patra's allegations, Congress leader in a press conference had called the Narendra Modi government ""data leak sarkar"" and accused it of ""leaking"" people's data by asking them to submit their personal information on the ‚ÄòNaMo‚Äô app.    ""Modi government is attacking the privacy of its citizens. Abki baar data leak sarkar,"" Singhvi said.  Referring to the recent scam by jeweller Nirav Modi and Mehul Choski, Singhvi slammed the government saying that not only is the people's money in banks, but their identities too are unsafe.  Singhvi also accused the Prime Minister of ""snooping on minors"" by asking them to download the NaMo app in his book ""The Exam Warriors"".  ""Mr Modi urged children to download NaMo App in his book Exam Warriors, Does he now want to snoop in on minors?"" Asked Singhvi.  Responding to the allegations that the Congress party's 'With INC' app was also sharing the users' data with a firm in Singapore, the Congress leader said that unlike BJP, the supporters of his party use offline means to connect with the party.  ""The 'With INC' App had 15000 downloads, our people preferred offline memberships. With INC App meant for people only interested to be our members, while Modi‚Äôs NaMo App has 50 Lakh+ downloads by ordinary common people. We are not a missed call party like the BJP,"" Singhvi added.  An hour later, Patra, in a press conference, said that the users' data shared by the NaMo app was as per the requirements of a ""smart app"".  ""Analysis is not equal to snooping or survellience. This is a provision of a smart app. NaMo app is no different from any smart app. Like all the smart app, it too, requires the users to grant access to their personal data to help enhance the user experience,"" Patra said.  Both the parties have been trading allegations over the use of user's data shared on the mobile apps of their respective parties.  On Saturday, the Congress targeted the NaMo app for alleged data sharing with a US-based firm. Earlier today, the BJP hit back at the Congress's allegation accusing the latter of doing the same with its app, 'With INC'.    Be the first one to review. We have sent you a verification email.

LUCKNOW: Accusing the of seeking to drive a wedge into the new-found bonhomie between her party with the , Bahujan Samaj Party chief on Monday said the two parties' ""friendship"" has been forged in national interest and not to meet any selfish end. ""The 's close ties with the Samajwadi Party are not for any selfish motive but in the national interest,"" she said, emphasising that the opposition parties will have to work jointly to stop the BJP from coming to power at the Centre.  She said the non-BJP parties should come together to address the problems suffered by the common people, including the poor and the youth because of the ""wrong policies of the BJP-led central and state governments.""  Mayawati said the BSP-SP friendship is also being welcomed all over the country.  ""The BSP and the SP workers will not fall prey to the BJP's designs in the interest of the nation and the people as we, along with all opposition parties, will have to definitely stop them from coming to power at the Centre this time.  ""Since the BJP is now finding this (tie-up) taking shape, their leaders are issuing unfounded statements against the BSP-SP relationship,"" she said, days after the ""understanding"" between the two arch rivals came in for sharp criticism from the saffron party, which lost key Lok Sabha bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur to the SP.  The BSP supremo also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks on dalit icon and chairman of the Constitution-drafting committee, Dr in his 'man ki baat' programme yesterday and termed it as an ""eyewash.""  ""In the past four years of their governance, they have been continuously indulging in theatrics on issues related to dalits and backwards and any more drama on the issue will not get them any political mileage,"" she said.  ""The country based on the principle of equality of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar can never be a reality under the government led by the BJP and the RSS as their mindset is narrow, communal and casteist which is against the very spirit of the Constitution,"" she said.  ""Because of such a mentality, people had kept it out of power for so long and now under the BJP government, dalits and backwards are lagging behind,"" she said, adding that the benefits of the Mandal Commission recommendations have been made ineffective by the government just like the reservation for dalits.

"Puducherry: Nominated BJP MLAs claim they were denied entry into assembly, stage protest - Times of India",timesofindia," The three BJP MLAs, whose nomination to the Puducherry assembly by the Centre was upheld by the Madras high court recently, claimed they were denied entry into the House by the police on the opening day of a brief session here on Monday. PUDUCHERRY: The three BJP MLAs, whose nomination to the by the Centre was upheld by the Madras high court recently, claimed they were denied entry into the House by the police on the opening day of a brief session here on Monday. The nominated BJP members V Saminathan, KG Shankar and S Selvaganapthy said they were prevented by the police, who were posted both inside and outside the assembly premises, from entering the House.  Lt Governor delivered the customary address in the assembly.  The three MLAs, later along with their supporters squatted on the road outside the campus and raised slogans against the police.  While squatting, one of the agitating members, Shankar, was suddenly taken ill and had to be rushed to the government general hospital located near the assembly.  The trio's nomination had earlier been rejected by Speaker V Vaithilingam.  The speaker, through a communication to the members yesterday, had said that he was not heard by the Madras high court on the issue of their nomination by the Centre and, accordingly, he stuck to his November 12 order last year, rejecting their nomination.  The speaker had taken the stand that the ""natural justice was not observed"" in adjudication of the issue of their nomination.  Chief Minister , meanwhile today, tabled a resolution in the House saying that the government would soon file an appeal in the Supreme Court, challenging the high court order.  The resolution was adopted unanimously by the House at the end of a detailed discussion.  The members who participated in the debate said there should be protection of the rights and privileges of the elected government here.  Another unanimous resolution urged the Centre to constitute the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) and the Monitoring Commission in keeping with the directives of the Supreme Court on sharing of the river water.  The Karaikal region of Puducherry is entitled to seven tmc feet of water from the river system.  Tabling the resolution, the chief minister said the centre should set up the board as per the court order. No other body would be acceptable to ensure the availability of river water for the delta farmers, he added.  He said his government is duty-bound to take care of the interest of the Karaikal farmers.  He termed as 'untrue and unacceptable' the opposition AIADMK leader A Anbalagan's charges that the government was not insisting upon the Centre to form the CMB only because there was a Congress government in Karnataka.   ""We will give no room for political passions and would insist upon our rights,"" Narayanasamy said.    Be the first one to review. We have sent you a verification email.

The lavish ceremony was attended by Premiers of SAARC nations, several Chief Ministers, Opposition leaders, besides a host of celebrities, corporate honchos and religious heads. For the first time in 30 years, the BJP came to power with an absolute majority and the swearing-in ceremony gave a hint that Team Modi was ready with a game-changing plan for the country. Two years into governance, we look back at the Centre's performance. Hits Yemen evacuation This was one of the during the times of war, since the Gulf War I. MoS Gen. (Retd) V.K. Singh personally oversaw the operation. The External Affairs Minister headed by Sushma Swarajearned laurels for helping the Indians living abroad, be it for from war-torn Libya or from Pakistan. Jan Dhan Yojana Anyone can now open an account in a bank, thanks to this financial inclusion scheme. Barely a fortnight after the launch, the yojana for the maximum number of accounts opened in a week. The scheme is a big boost in moving towards direct subsidy transfer. LPG subsidy reforms Initially started as a ‚ÄòGive It Up‚Äô campaign, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry headed by Dharmendra Pradhan to customers who earn more than Rs. 10 lakh per annum. The amount saved was used to give over five lakh new LPG connections to those who still use firewoods or kerosene stoves for cooking. Swachh Bharat Mission A pet project of Mr. Modi, sanitation ministry's Swachh Bharat mission got wide public support, especially on social media after celebrities joined the Clean India challenge. Not just stopping with cleaning the locality, the such as building more toilets, waste management and waste segregation. Real success, will however happen, when manual scavenging is completely eradicated. India-Bangladesh land boundary agreement When India is facing boundary disputes with every neighbour, this gives optimism that issues can be amicably solved over diplomacy. The people living in the enclaves that were recently annexed to India even exercised their franchise in the recently concluded West Bengal Assembly elections. Bankruptcy code At a time when bankers were grappling with huge rise in non-performing assets and government eyeing to create more entrepreneurs, was necessary. With the support from Congress, the law was passed in Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session where the ruling party was short of numbers. Real Estate regulation Apart from making the process transparent and keeping checks and balances in the form of a Real Estate Regulatory Authority, drafted by Housing Ministry headed by M. Venkaiah Naidu gave confidence to home-buyers. When housing sector contributes to nine per cent of GDP, this law, if effectively implemented by the States, is a game-changer in the housing sector. Yoga Day India‚Äôs lobbying got success when the United Nations declared June 21 as . The mass yoga performance at Rajpath, which was led by Mr. Modi himself, set the record of most number of people participating in such an event. Mann Ki Baat A first such initiative in India where a top leader addresses millions, that too periodically. The programme even during his visit to India. Digital India This flagship programme of Ravi Shankar Prasad's Communications Ministry aiming to create a knowledge economy and good governance is travelling in the right path. Every minister and every ministry is now on Twitter. A slew of e-governance measures like digital locker and feedbacks through are some notable initiatives . Misses Pathankot attack The attack at IAF air base, just few hours from the National Capital, is the first of its kind after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. There were differences of opinion over the way in which the encounter was handled, Home Minister Rajnath Singh at the time of attacks and to make things worse, there was confusion over the number if terrorists sneaked in to carry out the attack. The attack raised questions on the security-level at India‚Äôs military bases. Masood Azhar India‚Äôs efforts to add the name of Masood Azhar, the chief of JeM, in the UN list of proscribed terrorists to it. This is a major setback to India as Azhar is believed to be behind the Pathankot attack. India-Pak relations Much to the hype of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attending the swearing-in ceremony or the saree diplomacy, both governments nor has the firing across the Line of Control came down. Mr. Modi‚Äôs surprise stop-over at Lahore too failed to cut the ice. India-Nepal relations Anti-India protests flared up in Nepal after trade movements through the border were not allowed for many days. Nepal called it as it followed protests by Madhesis. All of these happened within a year of the Himalayan quake, when Nepal thanked India‚Äôs help in rescue and rehabilitation. Also, India couldn‚Äôt keep away Nepal from moving closer to China. Dissidence in Central Universities Smriti Irani and the Union Ministry of Human Resource and Development was in news for all wrong reasons. The at Hyderabad Central University, sedition charges against students of Jawaharlal Nehru University, the FTII students‚Äô strike, decision of of Aligarh Muslim University, closing down Ambedkar-Periyar Study circle in IIT-Madras, the list goes on. And some avoidable controversies such as or being taught at CBSE schools. Blackmoney Bringing back money stashed in off-shore accounts was one of BJP‚Äôs poll promises. The government gave a three-month window for compliance, but only 644 declarations were made. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley once the bulk of blackmoney is within India, but little has been done to contain the feeders of parallel economy ‚Äì higher education, real estate and mining. GST Bill/Land ordinance The government is unable to pass the in Rajya Sabha for the past two years. Touted as the biggest tax reform in Independent India, the government is unable to bring consensus. Same is the fate of . Though the Centre took the ordinance route to clear the bill, it was re-promulgated twice and lapsed on August 31, 2015. Uttarakhand fiasco The pre-mature imposition of President‚Äôs Rule in Uttarakhand, and victory of Harish Rawat in the Supreme Court-monitored floor test, is not only an to the ruling government but also to the BJP, whose attempt to gain from dissidence in Uttarakhand Congress misfired. Silence on fringe right-wing groups Law and order could be a State subject. Murders of rationalists and attacks on minority community by fringe right-wing elements may not be limited to the BJP-ruled states. But the Centre as well as the Prime Minister‚Äôs refrains from condemning or making comments against such attacks didn‚Äôt go well with the public. Women‚Äôs Bill The seeking one-third representation for women in Parliament and State Assemblies is an almost-forgotten topic now. Cleared in Rajya Sabha in 2010, the Bill is pending in the lower House, in which the BJP front enjoys comfortable majority. Wait and watch Smart City plans It is impossible to create a city, that too a ‚Äòsmart‚Äô one in two years. But the BJP government has kickstarted the process by short listing 20 cities in the first phase. Mr. Jaitley‚Äôs for the development of 100 smart cities. Make In India Another pet project of Mr. Modi to make India the manufacturing hub, the government is taking efforts by easing foreign investment norms, revamping labour laws and cutting down the red tape. India has conducted road shows abroad and Mr. Modi has to gather support. Many multi-nationals have pledged their support. EPFO reforms The government introduced (UAN) to all EPF holders to make transfer of PF accounts easy when switching jobs. The good name earned from the working class soon vanished when the Finance Minister proposed tax at premature withdrawal of provident fund. It was roll backed after protest by garment workers crippled Bengaluru. OROP The One Rank One Pension scheme, a long-pending demand of ex-servicemen was by the government, but with caveats. Premature retirees have been excluded and the pension review will be carried out every year. Though all demands of veterans have not been met, the government will be remembered for bringing a 40-year-long struggle to an end. Planning Commission to NITI Aayog Doing away with the more than six-decade practice of Planning Commission, the government came up with a think-tank approach to economic strategy. The acronym (National Institution for Transforming India) itself invited criticism of government pushing pro-Hindi agenda and opposition ridiculing it as aniti and durniti. For a nation so used to Planning Commission allocating funds every year, time will tell the effect of this new approach. UDAY The Power Ministry headed by Piyush Goyal plans to aid discoms and State governments to to improve the health of power distribution sector. Eighteen states have agreed to take part in the scheme. The plan also aiming to curb power theft and pilfirage, appears good on paper. What needs to be seen is how it is implemented. Aadhaar The government saved Aadhaar from turning to a white elephant by . However, questions remain on why was it made a money bill, would the constitution be amended to give more teeth to Aadhaar, or would the UIDAI compromise on privacy. The Centre‚Äôs Digital India and host of welfare measures rely on Aadhaar. Will Aadhaar be just another card or will it truly make a change should be watched. Ganga rejunuvation The Modi government created a separate ministry headed by Uma Bharti to clean the river and protect it‚Äôs ecosystem. The Namami Gange project with a budget of Rs. 20,000 crores over a period of five years has been cleared. Ms. Bharti Ganga will be cleaned by 2018. The deadline appears tight but nonetheless, the clamour for a cleaner river has gained momentum. Bullet train Imagine travelling to Mumbai from Ahmedabad within two hours? That‚Äôs what a bullet train would do if the is implemented. China has expressed interest in developing the Chennai-Delhi bullet train corridor. But a single bullet train corridor requiring about Rs. 98,000 crores questions the viability of the project. Welfare Schemes A slew of insurance schemes namely crop insurance for farmers, Atal Pension Yojana for the unorganised sector, affordable health insurance coverage, and the Jan Aushadhi Yojana for retail sales of generic drugs were introduced in the last two years.. In addition, the government has re-launched Kisan Vikas Patra and introduced a PPF-equivalent for girl child, the Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme. Again, in country known from socialist welfare schemes, the onus of welfare shifting from government to individual is an ideological change and may take time for acceptance.               Politicians and Diapers must be changed often and for the same reason - Mark Twain This saying of Mark Twain is full of arrogance but if we go beyond it we can see that they are sensible and practical words. Congress came to power in 2004 and brought phenomenal growth which is more than what BJP(NDA) has managed till yet, Under the NDA GDP growth was good in 2003 as well. you can see that except year 2007(onset of the Global financial crisis) we were skyrocketing to greatness. Then came the SCAMS but one important observation to made here is this Although the 2g and other scams broke out people voted again for the UPA. why ? because they were delivering in governance but growth slowed down as all the countries we were trading with got screwed because of the financial crisis and our software sector had no clients to make software for and growth became dismal and the scams weren‚Äôt tolerable anymore. Like Twain said the congress had become sh*tty. A young and ambitious country felt that this sluggishness is not for them. a vibrant, positive, and supersonic economy is what was demanded. ENTER NARENDRA DAMODARDAS MODI Two years after BJP reign they have taken a no nonsense approach. All these initiatives are the right direction but by now you‚Äôd forgot mark twain‚Äôs quote. The BJP will also become sh*tty over time and we will need to change them at which point we ll need a NaMo like man to take us forward. Are they even different ?? The two parties have identical economic ideologies. Both are Neo-Liberal and market friendly and pro-capitalist in the 21st century. Their ideologies differ Socially INC is secular, BJP is Hindu nationalist. but this doesn‚Äôt matter actually because our society is greatly influenced by people and not by political parties. So I conclude that Both parties do good work for the progress of the nation and lose track along the way and this is only human. So we need to keep them in check without any bias towards any party. (p.s. my opinion is null and void if Rahul Gandhi is the PM candidate for 2019 in which case please don‚Äôt vote congress.)             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  The major difference between BJP and INC government is that it has been 3 ¬Ω years that Narendra Modi and BJP have been ruling the India and even till now we are still discussing the scams of INC (2004-2014) scams only. Till date not even 1 scam has projected against BJP or its leaders.             Author has answers and answer views   In democracy all political party has drawbacks. Because parties are made of People and all people are not same. People are not perfect so aren‚Äôt the parties. But some are better than other. But with time and leadership it changes. Once people thought Congress was better, so they ruled over 60 years. Now people thinks BJP is better, so BJP is ruling. So, is BJP is better than Congress ? I won‚Äôt put it in that way. I would say BJP‚Äôs functioning is better than Congress right now. BJP has a better leader than Congress. BJP‚Äôs inner architecture is more democratic than Congress. Right now congress has more flaws than BJP. But it does not mean BJP doesn‚Äôt have any flaws. But if I put it straight: In current situation INDIA needs BJP more than Congress. Reason: For me I like BJP, because it has guts to take any decisions. And I personally think ‚Äúable to take any decision is the best quality any person can have‚Äù. As decision‚Äôs result could be good or bad. You are free to have different opinion. Thank you! Jay hind!             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  Comparison of Congress and BJP Governments.             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  Interesting question, thanks for A2A. I believe if Congress sheds dynastic politics and start representing majority, it will prove to be much better party than BJP. Reason is simple , India was built by Congress , in 1980s it was competing with China, the quality of talent and politicians produced by congress party still form backbone of this country. All institutions are built by congress, congress made sure deprived had a voice in traditionally feudalistic society which has made this countrys foundation strong, although rich don't like it. However after Rajiv Gandhi, Congress kept slipping from its core principles and post liberalisation it became too corrupt, Narsimha Rao did hold it together but still it wasn't the same national force as it was once. This along with BJPs pro hindu stance paved way for regional parties as well as BJP to fill leadership void. Idealogically BJP has conservative roots and will not appeal to a significant diversity of the country. They will have to prove themselves. During 4 years of Atal Biharis government it was still a moderate BJP. However now it's becoming aggressive, absolute in power and execution which might spoil the diversity or community relations in the country. While that is definitely advantageous but it's a known fact in history that absolute power corrupts. So, I will not be surprised if BJP promises are not met until 2019 or 2024. This will call for dissent and so it's possible BJP will try to block dissenters early on. We can already see that with many examples- bashing of news reporters, resignation of IAS officers, governess, EVM hacks, paid media, industry government nexus, demonetization, aadhar linking to taxes & mandatory. Independence of judiciary & judge appointments. Sidelining of old BJP members.All roads to gaining power are being checked and monitored thoroughly These are not good signs unless there is a positive strategy behind it. I have my doubts though. So they will still manage their vote bank and power with majoritarian controls. That only works for so long as party is able to hold all stakeholders together which is very difficult in India. Only Indira Gandhi was able to do it in tough times and times will get tougher going forward. Overall BJP has the required strength and power to govern but has no talent or experience to strike the right balance. If governance is what they intend to do. Congress has all the talent & experience but no leadership or power anymore‚Ä¶. Also with scams and corruption they have lost credibility. In current situation BJP deserves a chance as they are the only ones capable of bringing much desired progress or good governance to this country.              Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  Q : Which government is better, Congress or BJP? A : Subjective - good for whom and bad for whom? Keeping aside the ‚Äòchunavi jumme‚Äô and pre-election slogans also, I would say that BJP government is much better. Unfortunately the word Achhe Din has been misunderstood as ‚ÄòSaste Din‚Äô or ‚ÄòMuft Din‚Äô where all the farmers will get excellent price for the product, the mercantile agents get excellent commission and the buyer also the product very cheap. Moreover, all the loans get a waiver. Is is ever possible? Indians are not ready to tolerate ‚Äòshort term pain for long term gain‚Äô and want every thing within the very first term of Modi. Is it possible in a country like India? I do understand and appreciate that many non-issues are deliberately being made issues during BJP regime - Yoga, Sanskrit language, Geeta etc. And that is the reasons why such issues come up.

"Textised! : Will BJP win the 2018 election in Karnataka? - Quora,

",textise_quora,"I am a Kannadiga living in Karnataka. So I think I can answer this. Congress rule since 2013 has been pathetic. So naturally, they will be facing anti-incumbency. This will help BJP as JD(S) has it's presence limited to Old Mysore region. Also, BJP has a trump card ""Narendra Modi"". Amit Shah's efforts will be another big positive for BJP. Just that state leaders doesn't mess up things like ticket distribution (most unlikely, as Amit Shah will be concentrating full time on Karnataka). As the question is about BJP, I am going to analyze district wise from BJP's perspective: North Karnataka can be divided into two as North-East Karnataka and North-West Karnataka. Let me start with North-West Karnataka, as the constituency number 1 (Nippani) is from this region. North-West Karnataka (Kittur Karnataka or Mumbai Karnataka) Mahadayi issue might have an impact in 5-6 constituencies of Belagavi, Dharwad and Gadag districts. 1. Belagavi (Belgaum, Total 18 constituencies, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC except in 3-4 seats where MNS has it's presence) BJP is strong in this district. Even in 2013, when bjp got divided into BJP, KJP, BSRCP BJP got 9, KJP 1 and BSRCP 1 seat. Notably, MES (Maharastra Ekikarana Samiti) has it's presence in 3-4 constituencies. In 2013, it won 2 seats. It‚Äôs support base is mostly marathi speaking Hindus. So, if BJP can consolidate Hindu votes (both Kannada and Marathi) it can win 12-15 seats out of 18. B S Yediyurappa (BSY) led Parivarthana yatra was a big success in this district. Visits by Modiji and Yogiji along with Amith Shahji's efforts can change the scene for BJP's good. This will be true for other districts as well. 2. Bagalkot (Total 7 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC) BJP's fort in 2008, but had to settle for only 1 seat in 2013. If BJP maintains the momentum gained by the Parivarthana yatra it can easily win 5-7 seats. 3. Vijayapura (Bijapur, Total 8 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC except in 1 seat where JD(S) has it's presence due to a particular individual) BJP is strong in this district. In 2008 it had won 5 seats. This time, lingayat separate religion movement might have some effect in this district. But BJP can mollify this effect by bringing in independent MLC Basavanagouda Patil Yatnal. Yatnal was a minister in Atalji's cabinet and belongs to numerically dominant panchamasali sub-caste of lingayat. Parivarthana yatra was a big success in this district too. BJP can win 4-6 seats. 4.

Gadag (Total 4 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC) BJP had swept all 4 seats in 2008 and lost all 4 in 2013 due to division of votes between BJP,KJP and BSRCP.

Haveri (Total 6 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC) BJP is very strong and had won 5 seats in 2008.

Bidar (Total 6 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC except in 2 seats where JD(S) has it's presence due to a particular individuals) BJP candidate won Bidar Loksabha seat by defeating Dharam Singh, former CM from INC.

Dakshina Kannada (Mangalore Total 8 seats, Bipolar contest between BJP and INC) A short visit by Modiji after Gujarat election result's day gave a big boost to BJP workers in this district.

BJP can win 5-6 seats with distributing tickets strategically. 5. Chikkamagalur (Total 5 seats, 3 seats direct contest between BJP and INC and another 2 it's triangular) BJP had won 4 out of 5 in 2008. Later in bypoll it won the remaining seat also.

I just want to have a look in the near future. I have stayed in karnataka for 3 and half years, left only in March. So I have a little bit idea about that state. So BJP will win.              Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  Yes it can and it will in Karnataka in 2018. Reasons for it ; - Modi Wave : This is perhaps the biggest reason for the probable BJP win in Karnataka. There is Modi fever going on in the country and people are voting for him and not BJP. - Anti Incumbency : There is an anti Incumbency sentiments among people regarding the current Government which will benefit BJP. - Three Way Contest : Whenever three party are in fray BJP always wins like it did in Delhi,UP and Assam. Similarly in Karnataka there is contest between BJP, Congress and JDS. - Switch Over : The other party members like SM Krishna are switching over to BJP and some other Congress and JDS members are also joining BJP which will help them.            I would answer what will BJP need to do win in Karnataka. With all the above actions, I think BJP can win Karnataka.               My prediction: BJP can form a government with JDS but cannot get majority. Some of the things happening: Amit Shah and his team have been able to do magics in Uttar Pradesh. Here we have to see what magics he can do so that his party becomes superior over others.             Author has answers and answer views   This seems highly improbable considering the political situation in Karnataka but this can happen if BJP forms a coalition government with JD(S) in the coming assembly elections in the state. Karnataka is the first of the four states which will go to elections in 2018. BJP and Congress will be in a tussle to win majority seats in 224 constituencies in Karnataka and will be looking to secure above 113 seats to win by a majorityand form a government in the state. BJP has been motivated by the recent election results in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh and want their victory run to continue in Karnataka too. Karnataka currently has INC as the ruling party which won 122 seats out of 224 and forming a majority government in the state when the assembly elections were held last time in 2013. There are some strong reasons to back the claim that BJP won‚Äôt be faring well in the Karnataka assembly elections- While the survey results and political scenario in the state hints at a coalition government with the votes being shared between Congress and BJP with JD(S) playing the spoilsport. The only way BJP can form the government in Karnataka is if they convince JD(S) to form a coalition government with them. Amit Shah may play an important role here. However , in a recent interview of a spokesperson from JD(S) , chances of forming a coalition government with BJP was ruled out as they had bitter experiences with BJP in the past. Thanks! I have written a similar answer for the question on Karnataka assembly elections , please take a look at it once.              Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  In my views, they might not get the clear majority. When Yaddyurappa came to power in 2008, it was kind of a sentimental vote from the people of Karnataka. BJP had the clear majority and they made a mess of the next 5 years with almost everyone wants to be the chief minister, with Yaddyurappa himself facing de notification case and going to jail. Now coming to the 2018 elections, it will not just BJP and Congress that will be fighting for power, there is one more strong contender and that is JDS. Incase of a hung assembly JDS is more likely to support the congress as they did during BBMP elections, even though BJP was the single largest party. These things apart but these two gentlemen named Amit Shah and Narendra Modi can do magic. Its definite that BJP will contest the elections in the name of Modi. So if the people get into Modi wave then BJP might get the throne.             Author has answers and answer views   Politics is unpredictable. It is said that even a week is too long in Indian Politics. Presently nothing can be predicted .One survey gave BJP a lead and the other gave Congress a lead.Undoubtedly there is strong anti incumbency against the present Govt. But only one thing works in Karnataka and that is Caste. Even after Lingayat-Veerashiva controversy I don‚Äôt think It has affected Lingayat Vote share of the BJP as the ligayats vote for their caste leader. Secondly even after so many corruption allegations against Yeddiyurappa ,his party got a solid 9.8% vote share in 2013 , which is very good for a new party. Also BJP lost not only because of corruption allegations but also because of Yeddiyurappa and Sriramulu who formed new parties and divided the votes . Also 9.8% vote share of Yeddiyurappa and 2.7% vote share of Sreeramulu is big, considering the fact that even a minute 1‚Äì2% vote share difference can cause havoc to a party. Basically BJP lost because of wrong caste arithmetic. It also did not have the right people to lead the party. Next after rejoining BJP , Yeddiyurappa won from the seat of Karnataka in the by a margin of 363,305 votes.That was a very big victory margin . (Where as RAGA won by only 107,000 votes which was less then his previous win in the Nehru- Gandhi family bastion .) It must be remembered that BJP is very strong in North and coastal Karnataka and Bangalore. Elections and survey are a proof to this fact. In 2015 BJP won a clear majority in BBMP by winning 100/198 seats. Also it was the was the first time in 30 years in the State that a ruling party was defeated in the civic polls. Source:  We must also remember the Jan Sangh got a majority in Udupi municipality in 1968 and was mostly the second win for the Jan Sangh in a municipality election in all of India and it was also the first ever victory of the in an urban municipality in . In 2009 General elections , Karnataka gave the highest number of seats and votes to BJP ! when BJP was in power in Karnataka. And BJP won 17 seats from Karnataka in 2014 even though the Congress had won Assembly elections just an year ago.(Strong Modi Factor) But the only weak point of BJP is that it is weak in Old Mysore region. But with arrival of SMK things might change. Mostly BJP will definitely make good inroads into this crucial region. Also another week point is infighting between party members and weakening of party workers‚Äô morale .But with Narendra Modi as the star campainer , things can change and will definitely boost party morale. Surveys at this moment cannot be believed. Even during the 2014 General Elections the expected seats kept on varying and in the end the BJP got such a big win that mostly the BJP itself had not expected it.But considering the Historical trends and present disappointment with the congress the BJP might win .At worst it will be a hung assembly. Ultimately let us hope for the best. Jai Karnataka Vande Mataram. Source : Wikipedia Edit: A recent survey was done by A Kannada News Channel . A majority (61%) agreed that there will be a Modi Wave in Karnataka. A majority feel that Modi‚Äôs schemes are better than Siddaramaiah‚Äôs schemes.

"Textised! : What are the chances of the BJP winning the Gujarat 2017 polls? - Quora,

",textise_quora,"Hello, I am Gujarati and working in a start-up in vadodara. In all over India everyone will talk about Gujarat election result but we are not that much exited about election.Because this war is one sided war. As per my view there is no scope of any other party to win election in Gujarat. Here is the reasons: 1- Modi wave in all over India :- people of India seen the Gujarat development model of modi and as a Gujarati we feel and we enjoying that model so Gujarati will vote for modi and vote for development. 2- No competition :- You may heard that 6 MLA of congress resign and join BJP for the next election so in congress top leaders there is some conflict and that guide to there own loose. And in Gujarat there is no regional strong party like in west bangal, Bihar and tamilnadu. 3- Gujarat is a State of Businessman :- As our economy is growing and every businessman appreciate goverment work and businessman vote for the development and that again goes to modi. and many more reason for BJP win.      Related Questions          Yes,BJP will definitely win the election because there are some important points why Gujarat is unique than other Indian states-- Common problems in every state which are overcome by Gujarat due to BJP: Why Congress will not win : 1. Divide and Rule politics as per cast. 2.creating hatred among people. 3. Scams Just one example I want to give which will clear why BJP is better- My hometown is near Gujarat Maharashtra border near Surat..a small town(taluka) in Maharashtra called as NAVAPUR(end of Maharashtra) . From Navapur NH6 surat nagpur passes ,so from Surat to uchhal(end of gujarat/neighour village of Navapur)Gujarat govt has built a 4 lane highway before 6‚Äì7 yrs and then there was Congress govt in Maharashtra so no any development from Navapur to Nagpur (part of Maharashtra) till 2014 due to dirty politics of Congress and when in 2014 govt changed in Maharashtra then BJP approved all the pending projects and gave deadline also for every project and that Surat nagpur project(part of Maharashtra ) started immediately and Now 50% road construction is already done‚Ä¶..that's why BJP is way better than Congress‚Ä¶ I am not BJP supporter but I always support if something good is happening for betterment of country             Author has answers and answer views   Neta nahi Junta Chor Hai: (Translation: Not a leader but public are robbers) I am fortunate enough to stay in different states of India as well as different region-rural as well urban. What I found is that we, as junta (public), are very ungrateful for what we have received. Benefits from the government for rural Gujarat: Similar benefits are provided by government to poor section of society in urban areas. Rich junta: Please don‚Äôt crib for paying nominal tax amount. You are getting far more benefits than poor section. Naming few: Job opportunity, security and best facilities at nominal rate as compared to foreign countries. I agree that there are robbers in politics but if we are put into their position then we won‚Äôt be any different than them. I have seen a pseudo-honest officer claiming for fake hotel and travel bill. So, why don‚Äôt we stop this fight and focus on building a great India from this very moment? Don‚Äôt ask me how. Figure that yourself. Edited: English translation of title added.               To my knowledge i predict that Narendra Modi and Amit shah magic will again make the congress boat to sink in the political sea of Gujrat. Jotting down some factors - Predicting a 150 plus BJP win in Gujrat 2017 elections.              Chances of BJP winning Gujarat are decent enough despite years of anti incumbency, lemme explain why. This time the situation in Gujarat is little bit tricky, Congress and its gang of overexcited school kids (Read : Hardik/Alpesh/Jignesh) is giving hard time to BJP especially in rural belt, 20 years of Anri-incumbency is finally catching up with BJP, so this time it‚Äôs not going to be a cakewalk for BJP. Having said that, I expect BJP to retain Gujarat, though with a reduced margin because they are a well oiled machinery, it‚Äôs not a joke to defeat a cadre based party in its own bastion, for that you need to have all the stars aligned in your favor. There has to have massive anti-incumbency against the ruling cadre based party and a mass wave in support of opposition party led from the front by a mass leader. Classic case is of 2011 West Bengal election when Mamata Banerjee finally uprooted Communist rule from Bengal after 34 years. Anti-Incumbency existed against Communists in 2001 and 2006 election too but at that time neither Mamata was a mass leader nor TMC was considered a credible alternative to Communists but the situation finally changed and all the stars aligned in 2011 election, by then Mamata had become a mass leader in wake of farmer‚Äôs agitation (Singur/Nandigram) and people were fed up of Communists to the extent that they were saying ‚Äòanyone but Communists‚Äô. Similar situation does not exist in Gujarat as of now, there is decent anti-incumbency against BJP but not to the extent of ‚Äòanyone but BJP‚Äô plus there is no mass wave in favor of Congress, hell they don‚Äôt even have a mass leader in Gujarat whom they can project as CM candidate and they hope to unseat BJP in Gujarat ? lol. So the confused/dejected people will again bat for BJP, just like Bengali‚Äôs did for Communists in 2001 and 2006. This is not Congress‚Äôs ‚ÄòMamata Banerjee‚Äô moment in Gujarat. For that they have to work really hard, in Haryana we say ‚ÄòSadke naapni padti hai‚Äô which roughly translates to ‚Äòyou have to work on streets‚Äô and they need to groom a local leader with whom people can identify themselves. In nutshell, Congress will give BJP a run for its money this time but in the end BJP will retain the state. In worst case they will scrape through with 90‚Äì95 seats and in best case they might repeat their previous performances of 115‚Äì125 seats.             Author has answers and answer views   It looks like a daunting task now but they could still be in the game for around 115 seats. BJP and Congress are fighting for seats in 182 constituencies which were predominantly dominated by BJP from 1995 with a brief spell of Rashtriya Janta Party in between and Narendra Modi (BJP ) being the longest running Chief Minister of the state for a span of 12 years in a row. It was deemed that Narendra Modi has cast a spell one the politics of Gujrat and seemed invincible before being the chosen Prime Minister candidate. He worked hard for the state and raked in the development model of Gujrat and showed the same vision to the people of india and was given a chance to lead the nation. The battle is set again in his home state but the result isn‚Äôt clearly obvious this time. BJP is losing its charm in Gujrat with people not being content with his latest bold measures of demonitisation and GST. Moreover , the latest agitations by OBC ( lead by Alpesh Thakor ) - Patidar ( lead by Hardik Patel ) - Dalit - ( Lead by JIgnesh Mevani ) communities creating an uproar of a change in the politics of Gujrat this time around. The Patidars account for over 16% of the State‚Äôs population. Most of them have traditionally been with the BJP. The OBCs account for at least 40%, and the Thakors, who form 26% of the population, have drifted to the BJP from the Congress. While Dalits are traditional Congress voters, some have switched allegiance to the BJP. But they make up just 7% of the population. With the OBC and the Patel communities turning their back on BJP and joining the congress , there could be lots of twists and turns regarding the number of seats which BJP gets in Gujrat this time. There are several factors which could hurt BJP this time - The average growth in Gujarat‚Äôs agri-GDP between 2002-03 and 2013-14, when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister, was 8 per cent. In this period, all-India growth was about 3.3 per cent. But, growth has since declined in Gujarat. In 2014-15, its agri-GDP shrank by 1 per cent and there was not much improvement in 2015-16 either. Source :  As of January 5, 2017, only one-fourth of the farmers in the State were insured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Of the 11.9 lakh farmers with crop insurance, 11.89 lakh were farmers with a bank loan. The deficient monsoon in 2014-15 and 2015-16 intensified problems. In 2016-17, there were good rains, but a bumper harvest in groundnut and other crops made prices plunge. The bonus over and above the Centre-announced MSP in cotton is a good move but not many are likely to benefit.Farmers in Banaskantha, Patan, Surendranagar, Morbi and Jamnagar districts, which were the worst hit by the floods in July, are also not going to benefit as they have suffered crop losses. 2. Failing businesses : Demonitisation coupled with GST proved horrendous for small and medium traders , artisans , craftsmen. There is a huge discontent among small businessmen \ traders with the GST and Demonitisation as their market was predominantly dominated by cash. Demonitisation with GST in tandem robbed them off many major clients from Mumbai and Rajasthan who inturn prefer to buy the stocks from their local manufacturer markets to avoid GST. There are many traders who have opted out of switching to GST and decided to work on cash and are repenting and complaining about the policemen who harass the stocks transporters for a GST ID. Small businessmen and traders are wary of keeping a full time CA for GST returns every 6 months which could cost them additional 5000‚Äì6000Rs per month for such an intricate tax return system and would cause additional financial burden and feel that they are betrayed by the BJP government for such poor implementation. Demonetisation also had a considerable impact on the revenues of the companies. Right after demonetisation, traders lost 55% of their revenue in the quarter October-December, 2016 and this trend continued on to the next quarter when it reduced by 40%. During the quarter ended December last year, small and medium enterprises reported 35% dip in revenues, large companies reported a 20% dip while exporters stated that their revenues dipped by 25% in the aftermath of demonetisation. Lets look at the chart below for impact on revenue of manufacturing companies- While revenues mildly recovered during the quarter between April-June, 2017, they again started to dip during the most recent quarter between July-September, 2017 on account of the rollout of the goods and services tax. The GST, which subsumes all indirect taxes that businesses pay on their inputs, was launched on June 1. Since its launch, it has faced a lot of glitches and businesses have been disrupted. In the quarter ended September 2017, revenues dipped for small and medium enterprises by as much as 30% according to the latest reports and 15% for large companies and exporters. Revenues, however, continued to increase by 10% for traders in the same quarter. BJP needs to be wary of these facts and find a way out to avoid these issues to become the reasons for their downfall. 3. Growing unemployment : A new report published by All India Manufacturers‚Äô Organisation showed that the impact of the abrupt withdrawal of 86% of currency one year back has had a massive impact on manufacturing companies across the country resulting in massive job loss and less job creation. The report surveyed 10,000 respondents across the country, ranging from businesses such as trading corporations, exporters and manufacturers of varied sizes. These included large companies as well as micro, small and medium enterprises. It found that 45% of jobs in trading organisations were lost in the quarter October-December, 2016, that is in the first 52 days of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes ceasing to be legal tender. During the same period, medium and small enterprises were also hit hard with 35% of jobs going away, while large companies saw 15% of their workforce shrink, the survey found. If we take a look at the scale of job creation in manufacturing companies in Gujrat - Some recovery seems to have happened since then in the quarter between April-June this year when micro, small and medium enterprises reported 15% increase in jobs, while traders reported 10% of jobs coming back. This was coupled with exporters and large companies reporting about 15% of their jobs returning. Considering this is Modi‚Äôs homeground , he ought to change this scenario or it wouldn‚Äôt be long when BJP gets dethroned from their long held state. 4. Mounting attacks on Dalits : In a pattern seen in several villages across the state, Dalits are being attacked by members of the upper-caste community for going against generations-old norms. Source :  Gujrat was hit by a series of scathing attacks on the Dalits by people of upper caste community causing a huge furore and acting as a fuel to the burning fire of discontent for the law and order \ demonitisation \ GST implications. These issues are taken up by the opposition parties and no stone is left unturned to target BJP for their responsibilities towards minorities of the state. Despite all these issues , BJP is presumedly said to be winning as per the latest poll survey in Gujrat and the fight has intensified. A recent pre-poll survey showed BJP was still ahead in the race for Gujrat and would go on and bag 47% of the votes in Gujrat. This however , is a big decrement from the solid position BJP was in few months back in August when the pre-polls showed that BJP are gonna sweep aside 51% of the votes. According to the survey, the ruling party will win 113-121 seats, the Opposition party will get 58-64 seats, and others may end up with 1-7 seats in the 182-seat Assembly of theState. The survey predicts that the BJP is likely to get 46% vote share while the Opposition party is likely to get around 41% of the vote share. However, notwithstanding the prediction of a victory for the BJP, the second round of the pre-poll survey shows huge gains made by the Opposition party in the last two months, as the BJP‚Äôs vote share falls. In less than three months, the Opposition party has gained major ground in two politically important regions: Saurashtra and Kutch having 58 Assembly seats, and north Gujarat with 32 Assembly seats. These issues and the discontent among the people of Gujrat has started taking a toll on BJP as of now. There is a huge mind shift in Gujrat which is bent on to bring about a change in the politics of their state and are in a mood to give Congress a chance. With the minorities shifting towards the Congress and a wave of poor results post bold moves by the Prime Minister could likely pose a threat to their longest kept state. Keeping up with the latest happenings - It is deemed that Narendra Modi will take charge of the Gujrat campaign. As Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Navsarjan Yatra in north of Gujrat ended on Monday, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat is set to launch its massive campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Modi is likely to address one big rally in each of the 32 districts in the run-up to the Assembly polls in the State. Pre-poll results are often a deviation away from reality , but we can still get a feel about the state of mind of people in Gujrat right now. The battle has immensely intensified , lets see who gets out on top. Thanks!

We slept peacefully than before our teacher woke us all as we where about to reach our destination. We were astonished to see clean and neat Ahmedabad city with disciplined vehicles and cops effectively handling the traffic. Greenery that was artificially generated and serene path ways across. Industries at far ends which could never be felt but only be seen from here. At first sight anyone could understand that its a well built city. Its 6 years now and obviously there would have been a lot of changes in betterment either which are very evident. ‚ÄòA state which was hit by dangerous earthquakes and by communal riots, brought to this stage is a completely miraculous journey and BJP is part and parcel of this conversion‚Äô I guess, the people of Gujarat aren't mad enough to vote BJP out from this developmental sequence they are in. I strongly believe there isn't a minute doubt to who is gonna win Gujarat- ‚ÄòBJP' Note: I am not a BJP bhakth but I can't deny what I saw, what I experienced and what I got. Yes, am a Modi fan! Image Source: Google Images -                Chances of Rahul Gandhi winning the election is ‚ÄúIf Rahul Gandhi joins BJP!‚Äù I went to vote on 14th was around 8:30 A.M when I reached the polling booth. I was standing in a long queue waiting for my turn to vote. I got to notice two housewives standing beside me. They seemed to belong from lower middle class family. As they were little louder in their conversation, I heard some pieces of their conversation. Lady 1: You know whom to vote,right? Lady 2: Of course, we need to vote for Modi. Lady 1: Be cautious. We cannot take a chance to mistake Lady 2: Yes, I know! I remember that I have to vote for number 1. Only BJP! Incident 2: Another day, I was just changing channels in television. I gave rest to buttons of the remote when I saw one channel which saw area around where I live. Reporter was roaming around the area where I live. She was choosing random people and asking whom they would like to vote. I would just describe one conversation which would summarize all the ones. Here is talk between one ordinary lady and reporter: Reporter: Didn‚Äôt GST/Demonetishation impact you? Lady: Jo Modi ji ki tarah mahenat karna jaanta he aur sahi kam karta he , use kuch nai fark padta(Who knows how to do hard work and always work with honesty like shri narendra modi, is never affected) Reporter: What do you think about the patidar agitation? Lady was little louder this time. Lady: Hello madam! Me patidar hu, par muje reservation nahi chahiye. Reservation wo mangte he jinhe mahenat nai karni hoti. Ham khush he!(I am patidar but I donot want reservation. The people who ask for reservation are lazy. We are happy) When ladies around her heard this, they gathered around her and together they said,‚ÄùMODI,MODI AUR SIRF MODI‚Äù Whole event was live so it was hard to believe it was promotional event by BJP. Also,I knew some of the ladies. Sparkle in the eyes of housewives eyes while saying ‚ÄúModi‚Äù has cleared my all doubts. In both the incidents, It seemed to be only 2 incidents but it precisely tells lakhs and crores of gujaratis says who witnessed ‚ÄúGujarat Model‚Äù Again I would repeat, Chances of Rahul Gandhi winning the election is ‚ÄúIf Rahul Gandhi joins BJP!‚Äù Also, let me clear one important fact, I don‚Äôt mind if someone likes and upvotes my answer!

"Textised! : Will the BJP win the Indian elections in 2019? - Quora,

",textise_quora,"BJP Can Be Undone in 2019 Besides handing out a formal victory to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the sixth consecutive term, emulating the Left Front Record in West Bengal, the assembly elections in Gujrat have sent out some other calls as well. Two of these inter-related ones are the announcement of Rahul Gandhi arrival as a serious challenger and the vulnerability of Bjp in free and fair elections of 2019. Gandhi has finally shed his reluctance to take on the task of reviving his party and has thrown himself full time into it with all his energy. Far more significant is the fact that during his extensive Gujarat campaign, he refused to react to the agenda set by the BJP, spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which had nearly become the norm since around 2012-13. He was constantly setting his own agenda and forcing Modi to respond to it. Modi did so by jumping from one wild allegations to another inconsistently, in a characteristic attempt to divert attentions from the sharp attacks on the disaster brought about by his ‚Äúreformist measures‚Äù. Gandhi had obviously given considerable thought to setting his own agenda: focus on the economy on behalf of those who had suffered most over the past three years and a half and to sidestep the question of his religious identity as irrelevant to the electoral battle by visiting Temples, if a bit clumsily. His constant refrain was the favours given by the Modi government to ‚Äúfive or six‚Äù corporate houses and the wilfulneglect of poor farmers, the small businesses and Tribals and the daily wage earners, i.e.‚ÄùMASSES‚Äù. Even as he mocked Modi and the government, his language was never below par, unlike on the other side. This too may have earned him some approval rating. By aligning the Congress with three angry though raw young men venting up social platform against the present dispensation, Gandhi also showed the maturity of a seasoned politician in forging alliances for electoral victories taken as an exclusive Modi-Amit Shah preserve. All in all, he stood up with his feet firmly on the ground. And he landed up with respectables result for it. He has demonstrated that he is his own man. Victory and defeat are after all relative terms. The Modi-Shah triumphant march to claim 150 seats out of 182 on the other hand was given a short shrift by confining their party to 99, just above the half way mark. Of course 150 would be dismissed by Shah as a ‚Äúchunavi jumla‚Äù much like the promise of 15 lakhs, i.e. not to be taken seriously. The dividing line between a serious electoral promise of the BJP and a non-serious ‚Äúchunavi jumla‚Äù is getting harder to detect. Problem of credibility? At any rate, the Gujarat elections did show that alternative agendas have replaced a single agenda. Where do Congress and Gandhi go from here? Not being a committed Congress supporter, I could fairly announce ‚Äúnone of my concern‚Äù; but as citizens it does concern us all whether we are being led in one direction or another by our political class. We would thus expect that Gandhi, besides sharpening his focus on the economy, would also take up another, perhaps even graver, challenge to the integrity of the Indian nation posed by the Sangh parivar: the assault of Hindutva on bharatiyata. The BJP did raise its hackles during the elections over Gandhi‚Äôs religious identity and he sought to respond to it by overly demonstrating his Hindu, evenjaneu wearing, self, the conventional soft Hindutva response to hard Hindutva. A very defensive soft Hindutva at best, much like attempting to win over the hardcore Mullahs by quoting the Quran and the hadees to them. Even at a personal level, at least three strands of religious identity mark Gandhi‚Äôs being: the Kashmiri Pandit, the Parsi and the Catholic, and to foreground one of the three is not the most honest or even endearing act. But far more important is the identity of Indian-ness, bharatiyata, which is by its nature inclusive and antithetical to a single exclusive religious identity. When asked by the Sangh Parivar to prove his religious identity in Gujarat, if he had responded with ‚ÄúMy religion is bharatiyata‚Äù, the questioner would have probably run for cover. But unfortunately that chance was missed. With as much energy as Gandhi put into his Gujarat campaign, highlighting the economic distress unleashed by the Modi government, he needs to now pick up on the other equally major disaster being wreaked upon India by the same forces. The economy can perhaps recover in a short or medium span but the damage to India‚Äôs cultural and social fabric would be far more durable and deadening. This needs to be taken up as an urgent campaign around the country, a campaign that is inclusive of all whose hearts beat for the nation. And one cannot wait until the dates of the next elections are announced to start this campaign. It is not hard to imagine that the electoral process and this campaign are intimately intertwined. The BJP‚Äôs Hindutva card is its chosen pathway to electoral victory; the bharatiyata campaign should be a counterpoint, a breaking of the link between religious identity and the political process. A bharatiyata that is not partisan to any segment, not weighted for or against any group of citizens. A campaign to proclaim: proud to be Indian. Civil society has already initiated some baby steps in this direction by launching campaigns like Not in My Nmae and Say no to Hatred which evoked massive response across the country, even as the initiatives were taken through spontaneous rather than organised action. The ground support for an organised and sustained campaign is ready. Will Gandhi, the Congress, and others take up this bigger challenge? This, among other actions, will be an important step towards rejuvenating the 132-year-old party.      Related Questions          No. BJP winning in 2019 is statistically improbable. Indian voters are very mysterious. The formula upon which they decide to vote is more mysterious than Duckworth-Luis formula. Lots of variable factors play their role in elections, its impossible to discuss all factors / some are already discussed. I will try to give my view through statistical point of view. At the same time I will try to be neutral and unbiased. Lets crunch some numbers first. 2014: BJP vote share 31.34% : seats won 282 : ratio between percent vote & seats = 0.11 2009: Congress vote share 28.55% : seats won 206 : ratio between percent vote & seats = 0.14 2004: Congress vote share 26.53% : seats won 145: ratio between percent vote & seats = 0.18 (source Wikipedia)  In the recent history, ratio between percentage vote & seats won was lowest in 2014. It means where BJP won, its winning margin was small and where BJP lost its margin of defeat was huge. In other words with a smaller negative vote swing BJP could lose its existing seats. and in order to win at other seats (where BJP is now 2nd or 3rd) BJP needs a bigger positive vote swing. In simple words from this point BJP can lose easily but to gain more seats they need big efforts. Point no 1: In 2014 BJP‚Äôs success was attributable to states like UP (71/80), Bihar (*22/40), Rajasthan (25/25), MP (27/29), Gujrat (26/26), Maharashtra (*23/48), Zarkhand (12/14), Karnataka (17/28) Chattisgad (10/11), Haryana (7/10) NCT (7/7), Uttarakhand (5/5), Himachal (4/4) . That is 266/327 Seats, almost 80% seats. that is pretty Impressive and optimum as well. Its the top of a curve, any further improvement is not possible but you can expect some correction. Its improbable to repeat the success story of UP, Gujrat, MP Rajasthan etc. So how much correction? 10% or 15% or 20%? lets have a fair estimate 15% correction, that is loss of around 39‚Äì41 seats in bastion. BJP need to cover those seats from rest of India. *In Maharashtra & Bihar, BJP has seat sharing agreement with its ally. Lets come to point no 2: West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra, Telangana, Tamilnadu, Kerala these six states have 164 seats out of which BJP holds mere 7 seats. BJP does not have great foothold in these states but lets asume in 2019 BJP will sure gain some seats. but how much? Even the most loyal BJP supporter will accept BJP cannot gain more than 7‚Äì10 seats in these states. That left us with remaining around 52 seats which include Punjab,Assam, Kashmir, North-East states and UT‚Äôs. of these 52 BJP has 20 seats. But Kashmir & North-East was never the BJP‚Äôs forte, BJP will surely lose Punjab and Assam is unpredictable. still asume BJP will maintain its 20seats in these states (though highly unlikely). Still BJP is falling short of majority mark of 273. In the answer I have not considered factors like, Opposition will be united & well prepared this time with grand alliance, Voters reaction to the current BJP government (sure there is some negativity due to no action on black money & corruption, GST implementation etc.) Minority votes will be united this time unlike 2014 (common this is a major factor in voting in India) But strictly on the basis of statistics I think BJP will not win in 2019. Please understand, I am not commenting who should win or not. Or who is capable leader. I am just expressing my view about 2019 election. Or may be BJP will form government with help of Alliance. But my main answer is strictly according the question.               Originally Answered:  I bet on it that, BJP is definitely going to win the 2019 election. WHY and HOW ? And if he is the candidate against modi, then Modi is definitely winning this elections..!!!!‚Ä¶(^_^) 3. Arvind Kejriwal may also be the candidate for 2019 elections from the AAM AADMI PARTY. And if he is the candidate from the AAP, then too BJP is on the higher side. No chances. (*_*) 4. Last but not the least, the most important and appealing thing to me is this. The Times‚Äô group had conducted an online poll. The poll results are mind-blowing (~_~). Though these 2019 elections are not a cakewalk for BJP, then too BJP has a greater mass on its side and too many advantages than that of the other parties and candidates.  Upvote..!!‚Ä¶(+_+)             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  BJP has a very high probability of winning the elections in 2019. in 2014, they had an unprecedented success in Northern India, so much so that States like Gujrat and Rajasthan gave them all seats, UP gave them 70+ seats and they had a fabulous success in Maharashtra, MP and Bihar as well apart from success in smaller states like Haryana, Uttarakhand and Delhi as well. They had hardly any luck in Odisha, WB, TN and Kerala as such in terms of number of seats but the unprecedented success in northern belt ensured that they had majority on their won. Now lets say in 2019, they can only loose seats from what they had in 2014 in the northern belt, i.e. their tally will be a bit less than what they had in 2014 if not a dramatic fall from 2014 tally. Among bigger states, Gujrat and MP, they will be able to retain like 2014, I see no issues as such except they may loose 1-2 seats there. In Bihar they had 31 seats but then that time BJP fought along with LJP and other smaller parties, now they have alliance with JDU which will ensure that they retain 30+ seats in Bihar and if luck has it then they can better their tally of 2014 i.e. about 31+ seats. Maharashtra can be a cause of worry for them, in 2014 they fought along with SS where as this time SS may take an independent stand and they may end up loosing seats. BJP may not want to have an open alliance with NCP, NCP option if only post poll and that too tactical for them so in Maharashtra they may end up loosing some seats if NCP and Congress goes to poll together. UP is in same situation, BJP can only loose some seats in UP due to anti-incumbency as well as due to the fact that Yogi's performance as CM will also come into picture in 2019. Now, how will they compensate the losses in the northern states and Maharashtra, that's where TN, Odisha and WB and Kerala comes in picture. With a not so strong AIADMK, NDA can expect to do well in general election in TN, and if they enter in an alliance with AIADMK, they can only hope to increase their tally by 5-7 seats there. BJP is working hard in Kerala and WB to take up the opposition slot and in all likelihood , they will do better in those states in comparison to their 2014 numbers. In Odisha, BJP is slowly replacing congress as the main opposition and will hope for a better number, in 2014 it was almost a swipe out for BJD when they won almost all but one seat there. BJP can hope to win more seats this time if they project Dharmendra Pradhan as the CM candidate there as assembly election will be held along with General elections in Odisha. Based on this analysis, I hope BJP will still come to power in 2019. The only real hope for opposition to make any dent to this is, if they win UP handsomely which is only possible if SP, BSP and Congress fights together and ends up winning 50+ seats. This is where Mayawati and her Party BSP will play a crucial role. BJP will do everything to ensure that Mayawati doesn't align with opposition in 2019 polls. This will be the single most largest threat to BJP in 2019. Apart from UP, even if Mamata wins handsomely in WB, she cant form the government alone without left parties and congress. So even if BJP falls short of majority for some reason, they will have a better chance of forming the government. So in all likelihood, the 2019 election slogan will be ""Aakhri Baar Modi Sarkar"" (as Modi will be 75+ in 2024 and wont contest the elections. PS: I am not a Modi fan but this is my practical view. Edit: The slogan i suggested comes from the 2004 NDA slogan i.e. ‚ÄúAakhri Bari Atal Bihari‚Äù, even ‚ÄúAbki Baar Modi Sarkar‚Äù is a copy of NDA‚Äôs 1999 slogan i.e. ‚ÄúAbki Bari, Atal Bihari‚Äù.             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  From all that we can see now and predict, there will definitely be an NDA government taking the oath of office after the 2019 General Election. What remains to be seen is if BJP will win over 272 seats (a simple majority on its own ) and Mr. Narendra Modi wins a second successive mandate. Given that UP, MH, WB, BR, which account for 210 seats combined will most likely see a BJP v ‚Äòrest everyone combined into one‚Äô scenario, it will be extremely difficult for BJP to win close to 50% of the popular vote. States like MP, CG, RJ, GJ may also cede some seats to the opposition as they hold a near centum seat share in those seats. In such trying circumstances, it is definitely possible that BJP gets seats in the range of 210‚Äì230. In that scenario, the opposition and other constituents of NDA will call this as a mandate against Narendra Modi and would want a political lightweight or a Lutyens Delhi candidate for the PMship. Remember, the paranoia of parties like SS, RJD and Congress is not the fear of BJP. It is the fear of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. They will do anything to unseat him and install a friendlier person in the PMs chair.             Author has answers and answer views   Let me make things simpler for you. Let us assume there are 100 eligible voters who will be voting in 2019 General elections. Government trust levels are generally determined by whether or not people consider their government stable and reliable, if it's able to protect its citizens from risk and whether it can effectively deliver public services.  Going by the Census 2011 data, the NDA states‚Äô population tally (740.1 million) is now nearly seven times that of the states ruled by the Congress and its allies (107.2 million). Considering the mean of 73 and 60, more than 66 people are going to vote for BJP. Removing another 6 people, considering political uncertainty and inconsistency, atleast 60 people are going to vote for BJP. In 2014, BJP got 31.3% Votes and got 51.9% seat share in the house [Interestingly, Congress with 19.5% votes got just 8.1% seat share in the house]. In order to become the official opposition party in India, a party must gain 10% of the seats (54 seats) in the LokSabha; however, the Congress was unable to attain this number. Considering political mathematics, absence of official opposition and Modi‚Äôs increased popularity, even with 50 people (50% vote share) will result in 70% seat share (380 seats out of 543) for BJP+ (NDA). So even a Mahagatbandhan (with lack of official opposition) is unlikely to turn things around! TIME speaks! Further read-                Let us consider certain issues and developments: To justify above points and our mentality, we have results of Bihar Election as proof where Lalu got maximum seats. Thats how illogical we can be.               Originally Answered:  Actually we can‚Äôt say anything, may be or may not be. But for the betterment of the country he should be become prime minister for at least two or three terms. The reason when I am saying ‚Äúmay be‚Äù are: But when I am saying ‚Äúmay not be‚Äù then I am really afraid of few things and started thinking about following points: Actually predicting common Indian‚Äôs thinking is very difficult and peoples memory are very volatile. When media started showing some thing and they listen certain things they started to believe on them and they are going to forget all the good things what happened in past. Basically it‚Äôs human nature, when we hear a lie multiple times we started to believing on that as it‚Äôs true. And history is witness of these things many times when People made huge mistakes in influence of moments and later realized that it was biggest mistake. I am sharing a real incident. It was 8th Nov 2015, I was traveling from Mumbai to Varanasi via train in sleeper coach along with my friend. It was Bihar state election result announcement date. Train was fully packed as next week was Diwali week. In our compartment very hot discussion was going on why BJP lost Bihar election. I was silent observer and just wanted to listen what other peoples are thinking about Modi and NDA. Surprisingly nearly 70% of people at that time thinking that Modi is not doing his job and nothing has been changed since he became PM. People are saying like ‚Äú Modi ko videsh ghumane se fursat mile tab to kuch kare‚Äù, ‚ÄúModi bas bolata h kuch karta to hai nahi‚Äù, ‚Äú bhai wo to bas bade aadmiyon ki baat sunata h‚Äù ‚Äú Kala dhan lagta h setting kar ke apne account me daal dia hai‚Äù. I was shocked to here such type of comments and nearly 60‚Äì70% of the people are believing in this. I thought they are not aware about reality that‚Äôs why they are talking like this, Don‚Äôt worry they will know and they will think positive. But next moment I thought who are these people? OMG they are the common people who are just talking without any fact and figure but they are voters, they will give votes and they can influence others in there place. Our 70% India lives in villages and a part of them doesn‚Äôt care about any fact and figures. They just follows what the other people thinking and saying or what the local leaders are informing them. Believe me in 2019 every opposition party most of the media channels are going to spread just negativity about PM Modi and new issues like intolerance and secularism and blah blah .. will going to be evolve again and again to stop Modi. But I have full faith in our country and country man that they are not going to be influenced by such issues. They will choose what is right and what is beneficial for the country's future.

"Textised! : Will the BJP win in the UP assembly elections in 2017? - Quora,

",textise_quora,"There are good chances that BJP will secure 202 seats (majority required to form the government) in this election. The party has learnt a lesson from Bihar elections where the‚ÄúVikas‚Äù rhetoric didn‚Äôt work in favor of it. What hurt the party more than the Grand alliance is its complacency. They didn‚Äôt want to repeat the same mistake in UP by being complacent after the landslide victory in Lok Sabha elections winning 71 MP seats with a vote share of 42.3%. (much of which can be attributed to the Modi wave) But before I list reasons why I believe BJP would win this election let me introduce the man who‚Äôs running the show for BJP in UP? Sunil Bansal Party president Amit Shah handpicked Sunil Bansal for the role of General Secretary of UP who previously assisted him in 2014 Lok Sabha elections in UP. Bansal was an activist of the ABVP, RSS‚Äôs student outfit ‚Äì in Rajasthan who later went on to become its national joint organizing secretary. Bansal who is Shah‚Äôs right-hand man learnt the importance of data compilation for electoral purposes, and slowly picked up the caste intricacies of each district in the state. He learnt from Shah the importance of organisational activities that would keep the party cadre busy and perennially connected with the people. Strategy What did they do in the run up to this election? (Brijesh Pathak with Amit Shah) My prediction would be a BJP government or a hung assembly which might result in an alliance of BJP with BSP. Sources:             Related Questions          I don‚Äôt know what the results are going to be but BJP seems to be on winning side in UP because :      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?          Originally Answered:  It is too close to call at this moment. SP is not only at a disadvantage due to anti-incumbency , but also due to its votebase being scattered. It's votebase ( yadavs + muslims) is no longer in the mood of indulging them, at least the muslims are not. Though the govt has of late completing the development projects, it has lost the goodwill of the people due to the infighting in the party. The infighting has wrecked the party. Akhilesh is quite popular though. Too bad for him. The lesser said about the congress the better. BSP has a good chance, though its coffers are empty thanks to demonitisation. If the muslims and dalits rally around BSP with brahmins also lending some support then there is no stopping Mayawati. With law and order taking a hit, urban voters would want to vote for her. BJP no longer enjoys the support it once did in 2014. General elections are very different from state elections. Also the effect demonitisation had on voters is not known. Though the Chandigarh local elections is a shot in the arm for BJP it is to be noted that Chandigarh is an urban constituency unlike much of UP. My hunch is that BJP will certainly increase its tally ,if luck favours say to 100. Quite possible. The fight is certainly between BSP and BJP. A SP-INC alliance would be disastrous for the SP. Sheila Dikshit will not win. Congress is somehow out of sync with the ground reality. A fractured verdict is also possible but let's hope it doesn't come to that. A BSP-Congress alliance is possible if INC gets around 40 seats (heights of optimism). To sum it up a BJP govt on its own- highly unlikely. It will increase its tally through.             Author has answers and answer views   My Prediction: BSP- King maker. BJP- Single largest party. Explanation: The BJP is likely to choose a backward caste leader to helm its Uttar Pradesh unit as it starts putting in place its strategy for the crucial assembly elections in 2017, sources said. The party will elect a new state president in the coming days and among the front-runners are legislator Dharam Pal Singh Lodh and General Secretary of the state BJP, Swatandra Deo Singh. The current state president, Laxmikant Bajpai, is an upper caste Brahmin. Closer to the assembly elections, the sources said, the party is expected to announce an upper caste leader as its chief ministerial candidate for the state, in a departure from its strategy in most recent state elections of not naming a presumptive chief minister. In most state polls since its mega win in the 2014 national election, the BJP has not projected a chief ministerial candidate, banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its face to draw votes. The strategy was seen by many to have backfired in the recent Bihar elections. The party believes projecting an upper caste leader for chief minister with a backward caste leader steering the party as state chief, will balance the BJP's appeal in India's most populous state, where caste has traditionally played a crucial role in determining election results. The BJP had won 71 of Uttar Pradesh's 80 parliamentary seats in 2014. The sweep was credited to BJP chief Amit Shah's strategy and a Modi wave. PM Modi won from Varanasi and chose to represent Uttar Pradesh, giving up the other seat that he won from his home state Gujarat. In recent civic elections, however, the party did not fare well in Uttar Pradesh. It lagged behind the ruling Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, which made a comeback after being wiped out in the national election, winning not a single take on the regional giants Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP will look at getting its caste balance right. Front-runner for state chief, Dharam Pal Singh belongs to the Lodh community, which makes up about four per cent of the state's population. Lodhs have traditionally supported the BJP. Former chief minister Kalyan Singh is seen as the community's tallest leader, but he is now Governor of Rajasthan and out of state politics. Since it became a marginal player in UP in the 1990s, the Congress has performed well just once ‚Äî in the 2009 elections. That year, convinced that it will form the next government in Delhi and the BJP is out of the race, the minorities and upper castes voted tactically for the Congress in several constituencies, taking its vote share to around 19 and number of seats beyond 20. But that performance was an aberration, brought about mainly by the belief that it was destined to win. Unless something dramatic happens, the general impression is that the Congress is destined to be wiped out, and, thus, it is unlikely to retain even its 2014 vote share in the next election. So, with the Congress out of the equation, the outcome of the election will depend on just one factor: how many of the anti-BJP voters abandon Netaji and line up behind Behenji. Whether the Congress contests alone or becomes part of an alliance is unlikely to make a lot of difference to the final result.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Let‚Äôs look at the sequence of events: Hence the qualitative scorecard is as follows: BJP: Early Mover but slipping on a banana peel Mulayam: Has quit politics to keep SP afloat till ‚Äò19 Mayawati: My enemy‚Äôs enemy is my friend. Pulling SP down the sinkhole Congress: Cautiously roping in Priyanka since they have understood that Rahul = Defeat Sadly, development doesn‚Äôt win you much in this part of the country.

Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  BJP does have a greater chance of winning the election. All other parties individually may at the most scuttle the chances of BJP and reduce it to largest party, thereby see that no party get majority. Out of the remaining if any two party join together then they may win majority. Then BJP may find it very difficult to get majority on its own. At present this seems remote since all the other major parties have announced their CM candidates. There are different schools of thought for BJP to win the election. By not announcing the CM candidate the party stands to gain. All the casts and communities which support the party will cast their votes to the party hoping that their caste leader will be the leader of the legislature. Non projection of leader is to their advantage. Polarization of voters have already taken place. Hence any further polarization through gharh wapsy or cow vigilantes will only boomerang on the party. But mention of ram mandir may help the party since vast majority are still great devotees of ram and looking forward to the construction of ram temple. Another school of thought feels by announcing a CM candidate, he will rejuvenate the party and take entire party machinery behind him, as is being done in Assam recently and Karnataka in 2008. But unfortunately or fortunately BJP do not have such a leader at present except Rajnathsing. But he is not willing to go to state politics. Hence at present it is not feasible. Coming to different caste groups supporting the party, forward castes comprising 18% (brahmins, thakurs, vaishya, bumihars , Kayastas etc) are now solidly behind BJP. After Dayashankar'S episode it was thought the party may lose. What followed later when Nazeemuddin used fowl language against Dayashankar'S 12 year old daughter and his wife balanced off. Further Mayavati did not at all take any action against her leftanant. This has infuriated the forward castes. Further BJP took prompt action immediately. Hence if BSP thinks that it can cash some Brahmin votes it is mistaken. The entire lot will go behind BJP Also a portion of other backward castes will also vote BJP because our PM belong to backward caste and also state BJP chiefe is OBC. It may not expect any support from SC and minorities such as muslims and christians. Among the youths irrespective of castes it may get some substantial support . On the whole BJP may get around 35% votes which is sufficient to get majority. Whereas BSP which was thought will give a tough fight to BJP has gone way behind now. It may come a close third behind SP.             Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  I am repeating what I had given in answer to a similiar sounding question. I am not a traditional BJP voter, but the wonderful performance of the NDA Govt led by Yug Purush Atal ji (1998‚Äì2004) had won my heart. There are a number of good things his govt did but the national highways plan tops the list. Then there was Kargil conflict. However, I particularly feel obliged to him for his decision to form three new states, including my home state Uttaranchal. What was great that he insisted on inclusion of Haridwar in Uttaranchal. Naturally, I felt sad when BJP lost in 2004. I voted for BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, because, like all the sensible voters, I too wanted to see the back of the shamelessly corrupt and brazenly arrogant Congress. In 2014, the basic aim was to remove Congress, and voters were looking for the best available alternative and somehow they found that BJP led NDA was the best option. Like most voters, I too did not expect much from BJP and Modi ji, since in my view, they came to power merely because Congress was not good and deserved to be dumped. Presently, I am impressed by the work being done by BJP led NDA Govt and in my view, Narendra Modi is not just the best out of all the leaders, he is actually far far better and no other leader comes anywhere near him in leadership qualities, integrity, and dedication. Regarding Uttar Pradesh, it is well known that BJP had won 71 LS seats of 80 seats and 2 more seats were won by its ally Apna Dal. Of the 7 opposition seats, 2 were won by Gandhi family of Congress and 5 went to SP‚Äôs Yadav family. BSP and other parties got nothing. In view of the good show in 2014, BJP leaders are expecting miracles in 2017 as well but that may be easier said than done. BJP is also keen to win so that it may later improve its tally in Rajya Sabha. The pressure is more in view of the unexpectedly big loss in Bihar. Now, the weaknesses of BJP are many, ranging from lack of a CM face to mindless import of defectors from other parties. Similiar charade is going on in Uttarakhad too, which will also have elections in 2017 almost simultaneously with Uttar Pradesh. Actually, locals fear that the mass scale defections from Congress may even lead to defeat of BJP in 2017 Uttarakhand Assembly Elections. While it would be difficult to predict victory or defeat for any particular party at this juncture but it is certain that BJP is not going to have it easy since SP still expects a come back, in view of its claims of development and clean administration. It is seen that the Akhilesh Govt did not attract any serious allegations of corruption. On the other hand, BSP is not yet ready to be written off. Mayawati sees BJP merely as a runner for the third place. While Mayawati is seen as a good administrator but some call her a dictator. There is yet another viewpoint that sincere voters would not forget massive scandals like NRHM, and might keep away from BSP. Congress is also there but the common perception is that it has not much hope. There is yet another threat from coming together of splinter parties under the leadership of Ajit Singh, who is being propped up by some anti Modi leaders from few other states, who have strong grudge against BJP, and particularly hate Modi. The imminent danger emanates from the highly ambitious currency demonetisation or Note Bandi plan, since poor people in both urban as well as in rural areas, and farmers are facing difficulty in view of the non availability of legally usable currency notes. BJP led Govt at Centre seems to be overdoing its cleaning act and needs to look at farmers issues (not just UP, but whole of India) and must provide them relief. However, it is a pleasant surprise that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is strongly supporting PM Modi for having come out with the currency demonetisation plan. It makes me think of the unthinkable. Think of it, will Nitish Babu rejoin BJP led NDA. The still best part is that the people are now looking at Modi with huge expectations and let us hope that the Modi magic will work in Uttar Pradesh 2017 elections as well. The people who think demonetisation has failed and that it will cause defeat of BJP in elections in 2017 and in 2019, are seriously mistaken. BJP may loose for any other reason like weak candidates, and if voting is along the lines of caste and religion, but not because of demonetisation. The people who understand the common psyche can easily see that there is going to be a dramatic change in the peoples‚Äô thinking about voting, about development, about corruption and clean politics, and drastic shift will be seen in voters‚Äô loyalty to caste based leaders and political parties, and the leaders who talk of religion for political gains will face the music, and also, henceforth, voting patterns would now see a huge qualitative change. Obviously, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the flavour of the season.       Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?

"RSS moots new mantra for cow protection | Lucknow News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," BJP's ideological fountain head, the RSS, is initiating a new cow protection narrative by calling upon its functionaries to organize a 16-day religious programme in the name of cows in various temples across the country. LUCKNOW: 's ideological fountain head, the RSS, is initiating a new cow protection narrative by calling upon its functionaries to organize a 16-day religious programme in the name of cows in various temples across the country. Shankar Lal, chief of Akhil Bharatiya Gau Sewa, an RSS wing, has issued instructions to Sangh workers through a video saying that the event from March 31 till April 15 will be a 'Mahayagya' in which people would chant a special 'Gau Mantra' in Sanskrit - ' Gau Jan Rashtra Jagat Hitayche"" - so that the 'bhaav' (feeling) for cow protection is instilled in them.  At the event, RSS functionaries will also organise exhibitions where information about cow protection would be disseminated, said Lal.  An RSS funtionary in Lucknow, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that a similar exercise would be organised in 'gaushalas' (cow sheds) and other 'pavitra' (pious) places where people will take a pledge to protect cows. ""This is like the programme of chanting ' mantras' during the Ram temple movement,"" he said, drawing parallel to the programme organised by in 2002 when members of right wing organisations were asked to mobilize people to chant mantras.  Sangh's renewed vigour vis-a-vis cow protection, comes months after several incidents of mob lynching and murder of people by self-styled cow vigilante groups over rumours of cow slaughter, became a critical point of political stand-off between ruling BJP and opposition. The attacks left BJP and RSS on a back foot with PM calling cow vigilantes as anti-social elements taking law in their hands. RSS chief had urged that while protecting cows nothing should be done that hurts the belief of some people.  Nevertheless, after storming to power in Uttar Pradesh last year, BJP government announced setting up of ' Gau Shalas' in all districts of the state.     Be the first one to review.

"Karnataka election 2018: Karnataka election 2018: BJP gears up for attack on last major Congress bastion | Bengaluru News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," The bell has rung for another BJP-Congress faceoff with the Election Commission announcing a one-day poll in Karnataka on May 12. The contest is seen as a quarterfinal ahead of the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh later this year, and the Lok Sabha elections next year. NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The bell has rung for another BJP-Congress faceoff with the Election Commission announcing a one-day poll in Karnataka on May 12. The contest is seen as a quarterfinal ahead of the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh later this year, and the Lok Sabha elections next year. The poll ‚Äî the results of which will be announced on May 15 ‚Äî is already heated with BJP and Congress keenly aware of the importance of the prize.   A loss will rob the Congress of one of two major states it is in office; the BJP needs a win to regain the momentum it lost after SP and BSP came together to win two prestigious UP bypolls despite a saffron victory in Tripura.  Karnataka is important for the BJP as a success here will mark a re-entry in the south by regaining a state it lost to the Congress five years ago after a rebellion by its senior leader BS Yeddyurappa. In a turn of events, Yeddyurappa, who returned to the BJP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, is leading the party campaign, while the party will bank on PM Modi as its mascot.  Newly installed Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is campaigning hard and the stakes are high for him as the party needs to prove its success in running BJP close in Gujarat was not a flash in the pan due to prolonged incumbency of a saffron government. CM Siddaramaiah has raised the stakes by declaring the contest as one between ‚Äúcommunalism and secularism‚Äù.  Karnataka will yet again test the Congress‚Äôs ability to take on the BJP as the record has favoured the saffronites since Modi became PM. As of now, Punjab is the only other major state it holds and retaining Karnataka is crucial to the Congress‚Äôs claim to being the main anti-BJP force and Rahul‚Äôs credentials as the primary challenger to Modi.  In Karnataka, the battleground issues are a medley of governance gripes, Hindutva, caste combinations and minority wooing. The BJP has accused Siddaramaiah of seeking to divide Hindu society by proposing to identify Lingayats as a separate religious minority though the Congress claims it is a legitimate demand of the community. The state government‚Äôs decision to celebrate Tipu Sultan Jayanti has resulted in a political scrum, with the BJP accusing Congress of another divisive move and the secular-communal faultline heating up.  The BJP is looking to a Hindutva consolidation to counter the caste combinations that Siddaramaiah is relying on. The CM, an OBC, is looking to leverage the backward vote in his favour. The move to declare Lingayats as a religious minority is a serious challenge for BJP and the party is hoping Yeddyurappa‚Äôs credentials as the leader from the community will prevent votes from drifting away from the party.

Shiv Sena was always vocal about its discontent with BJP, primarily because they wanted some the prime portfolios in the government despite not really having a very good numbers in election.

The buffalo will not run to east like cow but to the west, towards the direction of storm. This act of them inflicts on them lesser pains.

Author has answers and answer views             Author has answers and answer views   If we go by the past the coalitions were there after there was a silent understanding if greed in to loot. Unfortunately thst opportunity did not pan out with the BJP. We have witnessed vast areas where some fundamental changes have had a dramatic restrictions in opportunities to accumulate ill gotten wealth. This may be in defence contracts to supervision of huge grants given to states. The state level politicians who are largely regional satraps are largely riddled with rampant corruption. They have an easy option to blame theur shortcomings on the centre. They think that people are latgely unaware thst most of the state issues are state responsibility. The 2019 election is looming infront and these gangs would like to strike fresh deals to loot. They achieve local emotional support wh is translated into votes that will allow them to hoodwink the same people is a win win for them. If they manage to get a lucence to loot people will vote for them and if they can not strike a deal then they will go breast beating from the roof tops and people will bless them with votes! It is therefore expected thst these regional bands will make noises. It would be nice if people can see that the regional leaders are largely driven by personal greed. It would be interesting to get a view on how these regional satraps have amassed huge fortunes and the source if their lavish lifestyles. Do NOT forget their friends and families while making an assessment. BJP perhaps is not spotless but huge strides have been made in distribution of welfare with far greater transparency than ever witnessed. Licences to exploit the national resources are also more transparent and the defence contracts with far greater emphasis on indigenous production is worth noting. Elitist gangs of greedy Indians are finding all this uncomfortable. It is left to BJP to create greater awareness with evidence in this areas.             It's because they are afraid of becoming extinct in the political scenario. This is one of the most basic rule of politics to never ever allow to grow even your partner on the cost of yours. They are now watching that support of BJP and specially Narendra Modi is increasing even in those areas where once bjp was zero, so they are just trying to counter BJP and secure their vote bank             This is just blackmailing. Naidu has underrated Mr. Modi. Let us workout the arithmetic. Mr. Modi has numbers more than half what is required and the no confidence motion initiated by TDP will only boomerang and actually the BJP was anticipating Naidu ‚Äò s move. There is no tension in BJP camp. The loser is TDP.

In all the BJP-ruled states except Goa, the sale and consumption of beef is banned. If only Indian people could be as curious as they are about how Sridevi died? India would have been a very different place..           Author has answers and answer views   I have no reason to say that corruption is growing in the BJP regime. However, I also have no reason to say that corruption is reducing in the BJP regime. The fact is that it was mostly business as usual in old and new regime. The difference of perception is generally due to the fact that there is a considerable time gap between committing an act of corruption and its coming to light. Let‚Äôs understand the four phases of corruption. Phase 1: The Pretense of Honesty When a political party or a public servant acquires power, he pretends to be absolutely honest who has been send by God to remove all corruption from his department or the country. In reality, it takes some time for any new party to develop (secret) linkage with the corrupt officers and corrupt businessmen to engage in corruption. In the first phase of his power, he pretends to be extremely honest since he has not yet committed any crime and he has no skeleton in his cupboard. However, by being honest, you can‚Äôt raise (illegal) funds for your party or self. Soon a few right people (??) find ways to approach you and you gradually start helping them first for the party and then for yourself. This is the beginning of the second phase. Phase II: Breaking the Codes Once your code is broken, the news spreads (often by these right people) that they can get the work done in the new regime. Soon more and more people start taking their help in getting their work done. Everyone in the business knows the right contacts and wants to use it before others. Your reputation (of corruption) starts spreading quite fast, but still remained only within a limited number of people. Phase III: Spread of Discontentment When you help someone, your action naturally cause harm to someone. If government favours one party, the other party loses naturally, No government can help everyone and satisfy everyone. Hence, the losers in the game want to get even with their rivals and the people in power. They now start gathering evidence so that they can demolish the reputation of the government and kill their rival. They can hope only the new government to help them, because the existing government is now trapped with their partner-in-crime. Phase IV: Spread of the Stink Once the rivals get sufficient evidences, they tip off the opposition parties and media houses and give them the evidences. Soon the mask of the ruling class peels off and the hidden skeletons start tumbling. Everyone is now aware of the real state of affairs. Public start cursing the government and feel cheated and get disillusioned. Opposition parties are rejuvenated because the latest corruption of the present government makes the public forget about the old corruption. They are in business again. This cycle continues till the existing regime is voted out by the people. Then the new game starts with new players.

So it was all my assessment,every has there own point of view ,this was mine.. thank you           Author has answers and answer views   I can‚Äôt say that without any clear evidence (at least unless reported in newspapers). Corruption has become a standard feature in our society and it is only steadily picking up over time. I put the blame at the door step of our polity. As more & more politically influenced/motivated scams come to our notice, we tend to get disillusioned. And we also tend to rationalize ourselves cutting corners. When the example is set by political bosses, why bureaucracy should fight shy? They have their own protection, they buy it. Sometime ago, a sub-registrar told me, ‚ÄúDo you think I will keep all the bribe money you are paying? A good part of it will go up to the revenue minister‚Äù. BJP is part of the system. It would be very innocent to assume that it can be different. You either do what everyone else does & survive OR you simply fall by the wayside. There was one particular political party launched in Hyderabad some years ago. It simply could not survive because it had neither the money nor wide public support.              The above data conducted by Transparency International says that India is not able to end corruption in the last decade. It means that we can‚Äôt say that the Corruption has being completely rooted out from India, it‚Äôs true that we have improved a little bit during this govt tenure but meantime the trend is likely to be reversed when Loksabha polls are nearing. Still we ranks 81 in corruption among the 182 countries which is a concern for Indian Economy.            Originally Answered:  Saying that BJP government was corrupt (while modi was in Gujarat) is definitely wrong. If BJP government were corrupt then there were no chances of Gujarat becoming one of the most developed state in the country. Now the question arises that why Narendra modi was not in favor of appointing a lokayukta in Gujarat. Actually, this action could've effected the image of modi in a negative way (just like a dunce who needs to be supervised and is doubted for doing something wrong). Since 2014 election was about to come, maintaining the image and legacy of modi was a must for the victory of BJP.           Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  Most government entities are corrupt to an extent. They have a lot of power and easy ability to abuse that power. Money can always sway people If I offered you an extremely high amount of money to do something, more than likely you are going to do it even if you don‚Äôt agree with it. Everybody has a price tag. That being said, not every government entity is so corrupt that they don‚Äôt care about its people. The choice in which entity you choose is the choice between which one you believe is more corrupt or which will hold your interests better.     View More Related Questions Still have a question?

The result of the by-polls in Phulpur and Gorakhpur are being discussed much in the media because of the symbolic significance of the constituency. But, if history is any lesson for common man, it can be concluded that in a democracy no leader is invincible, no constituency is lifetime bastion of a particular party. In different context and phase of time, voter choice is subjected to change based on his unfulfilled demands. BJP who has successfully constructed voter base gathered from array of communities belonging to different caste and class lines failed to pay attention to ‚ÄòNishad‚Äô community, an extremely backward caste in the region. SP and BSP alliance mobilized the community against BJP and won the elections. SP and BSP, who are arch rivals in the state of UP for last two decades have successfully managed to test their alliance in these two constituency. But imagine these two parties fighting together against BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections at national level. In my view, both these parties have to trade lot of compromises to sustain their alliance. By-polls could be won with limited financial and human resources, but to arrange resource at the scale of national level, SP and BSP have to work together from today only. They will commit mistake to project the result of this by-poll election with their fate in the upcoming general elections. They shall care to accept the fact that BJP is a star campaigner, supported by best minds in India working 24*7 at the back end to enhance their chances of not winning election but winning with heavy margin. The by-poll result, in my humble opinion is an alarm bell for BJP and a moment of celebration for SP and BSP. Sources: The Indian Express and other news website. View-Personal.

Related Questions      Author has answers and answer views   There are 17 answers to the question , with people raising question mark on selection of candidate for Gorakhpur and insinuating unhappiness of Yogi in selection of candidate and , Anti-incumbency, PM and President of BJP not canvasing and low voter turn out, particularly in Urban areas, etc etc but I have a slightly different take on the election and would like to share my views with the readers. Gorakhpur has been the safest seat for BJP and BJP has been winning the same since 1989, and the last MP Yogi Adityanath has been elected for 5 consecutive terms and was promoted to be CM of the state just 10 months ago. Insinuating that the candidate selected to replace him was not to his liking s raising a question mark on loyalty of Yogi Adityanath towards his party BJP and parent RSS, and is totally against the ethics and propriety as propagated by both these organisation. Anti-incumbency against CM & BJP, anti-incumbency does not come into play on seats like Gorakpur and insinuating there was anti-incumbency against BJP government and CM in the state is odd as the government is not even 1 year old and conventional wisdom says it takes 3 years for anti-incumbency to set in. Gorakhpur is not a seat where PM or BJP president need to canvass , and if PM and BJP president need to canvas extensively in constituency like Gorakhpur then what is definition of safe seat and it raises another question if Gorakhpur need extensive campaigning by them then what about other 542 constituency . Low voter turnout has always been implied as positive by BJP as its cadre and support base is taken as solid and it is said that they always come out and vote and it is generally the cadre and support for the other political parties which is described as FICKLE who do not come out to vote. But BJP lost the election to Gorakhpur seat and what does it implies: a. If BJP can lose a seat like Gorakhpur than anything is possible. every political party should note this as in future there are chances the same can happen to similar seats across board. b. Success tasted by BJP in UP in 2014 and last assembly election was a result of opposition vote getting divided and this bursts the bubble of popularity and acceptance. c. The social engineering affected by SP+BSP coalition has potency to displace the BJP apple cart in future. d. If there is credible opposition candidate who has chance to win , voters will vote in their favor. e. The good governance and so called changes being affected by BJP government is again a BUBBLE which got punctured. f. The brushing aside of issues and painting everything as hunky dory , taking criticism personally , using un-parliamentary innuendos , trying to name & shame opponents , trying to create a polity as we and them etc has shelf life and such efforts are reaching their expiring dates. g. In near history it has happened for the first time that Ruling party has lost by elections to the seats vacated by both its CM and Deputy CM within a year of coming to power. h. The sheen of Invincibility on BJP has started coming off and a dent to TINA( There is no alternative) has been made and the election since Gurdaspur by poll are pointing towards the same. i. Economic distress, unhappy middle class, unnecessary social stress, communal overtones , propensity to preach and order, dearth of meaningful dialogue and discussions in public discourse, putting self on high pedestal and looking down on everything and everybody , silence on contentious issues, instigating citizens against each other etc can be few reasons why Urban voters largely remained indifferent to polls. How these elections should be read? It is my opinion that its still early days to read too much into the results, except it opens new possibilities, and there are opportunities for opposition to explore and exploit, and chances are that the talk of preponing general election with state elections to Rajasthan/MP will be more subdued. The economic distress because of failure of demonetization and erratic implementation of GST and constant overlooking of middle class interest along with FARM distress are a reality and is affecting people , The propaganda for positive change/good governance/new India is a bubble and waiting to BURST. We live in democracy and in parliamentary democracy alternates are found and elected and the popularity of a leader and TINA are reasons generally articulated by dictatorships and in parliamentary democracy a party should win largest seats to form a government and there are chances that alternates to many sitting members are found in 2019 and NDA ‚Ä¶..              I'm living in gorakhpur since birth so I can surely answer this. Firstly, only 47% voting happened in by elections than usual 55%-65% at time of general elections. The city is main base of BJP gorakhpur and voting here was meagre 30%( that too in Muslim ghettos), the middle class lacked enthusiasm to vote and took it for granted. So, this low voting had already written the script of defeat, still it was a close contest. Secondly, Nishads are the highest in terms of caste nos. in gorakhpur and the coalition of SP BSP and NISHAD concentrated all the casteist votes in their favour. Thirdly, this time Yogi was busy mostly in Tripura ( it has 30% Nath population) for campaign and adequate time wasn't given here. But development works are going all around the city. There is no anti-incumbency or people's mood against BJP( although some may be unhappy but not to that context) otherwise it wouldn't have performed so well in local elections about a month ago. It has just been a case people didn't come out to vote. Remember even 2014 general elections were won by BJP when voting percentage was about 65% . Edit: As I said, BJP got 55% votes in the city which is the main bastion of Yogi, but overall voting percentage in city was too low, eventually the main reason for Bjp's loss. Casteist stronghold too helped the coalition of sp-bsp‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and whatever the news media likes of Ravish Kumar (who was doing Naukri series when bjp won 3 North East states but gave full primetime analysis to by-election) and others say I can tell you people don't give a damn about it. The bastion is still intact. And people who say that hospital tragedy created effect, I can tell you for last 15 years I've been reading Dainik jagran and it is many times seen on 5th page that so and so no. of children died due to encephalitis in medical college. People have become habitual of such news. Just read the stats in case you want to know. Edit2: As I have talked to few more people then I came to know that some people of PASWAN community were not happy for the stringent actions being taken against BJP MP Kamlesh Paswan and that led to some shift of votes, although he was from same party. Also people are unhappy about the rising prices of construction materials as Yogiji had put an end on illegal mining. Also this year there was strictness in board exams and as a result 1.5 MILLION students left the exam. So, a quite portion of electorate didn't take well the idea of good governance too. Hope they get to know better next year.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   Reasons To Lose Gorakhpur & Allahabad: Candidate + Anti-incumbency: The BJP candidate was not of Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs choice and thus his followers from Gorakhpur (Hindus & Muslims both) did not vote in these by-polls. This resulted in the lower voter turnout since people were ready to take a chance after 28 years to vote for a non-BJP candidate in such situation. On the other hand, SP-BSP were in a do or die situation and thus they put extra efforts. Their supporters were keen to go out and vote for this alliance. Thus, most of the 48% people who voted were from the anti-BJP group. Absence of Amit Shah and Modi: Modi and Amit Shah were not very much keen to involve themselves personally into these by-poll elections. This resulted in the division of votes to various parties and BJP supporters to not vote. In fact, if you look at the by-polls all over the country BJP does not seems serious about them. Target of BJP is to win Assembly / General elections. What I think is that through by-polls BJP reads the strategy of the opposition parties and then use it in the main elections to prepare itself. Poor and Lower Income Group: This section of society lacks basic needs and they hardly receives the benefits given by the government. They are unaware of various schemes launched by the government and do not have sources / mediums to communicate with the government. This results in division of votes. When Modi and Amit Shah does all the rallies, they attract a lot of crowd and votes are shifted to BJP. SP-BSP Alliance: It was evident that SP will join hands with BSP after a failed trial with Congress. SP & BSP both are more of regional parties with lesser presence out side the state. They had to get together for their survival and they did. This partnership shifted the votes of Yadavs, OBCs, Muslims & Dalits to one side. Attitute of People: In a state where around 15 lakh students do not appear for Board Exams just because cheating was not allowed, what do you expect from them, to vote for development or vote for Cast and Religion? People of UP are still very much interested in Cast and religion based politics. They are happy with a leader of their own cast at the cost of development and growth. Point to be noted: While this might have bring some happiness for SP & BSP, they should not take it for granted assuming that people are getting sick of BJP or Modi. People of India are currently under experiment mode. They do not mind to have some local or other parties than BJP at root level but they would still prefer BJP for the central government. This is evident from the fact that Congress did really bad in these by-polls as well. Well nothing else was expected from it either. When it comes to Loksabha elections at national level, Indians would still prefer BJP to any opposition party because the base of SP & BSP is not very strong in other states and they are sick of Congress totally. A united opposition will also not help them to win because an alliance with Congress means suicide for any political party and then there is no other leader in opposition than Rahul Gandhi who would have a recognized face all over India. BJP, on the other hand, should see the bell ringing. It should not take people of India granted. The present government is trying very hard towards the nation‚Äôs growth but most of the Indians are middle and below middle class. They are more concerned about the current issues and problems rather than to care for the future of India or of their children. BJP should not go very strict towards it policies and must keep in mind that a healthy India in future is possible only when people are ready to change. The current government should not just bring new policies but also try to change the ‚Äútypical Indian mindset‚Äù and merely advertising to give up LPG subsidy is not enough. Government have to take it to a new level and should try to involve as many people as possible in its schemes and activities so that we know first hand that what are the changes required, why are they important and how it should be done.             Author has answers and answer views   BJP vote share in Gorakhpur in 2017 assembly election was 42% and SP BSP combined vote share exceeded 50%. So if SB-BSP combine by itself will win if vote share stayed at same level. This time Congress lost deposit. It means most of congress votes could also have transferred to the combine. When SP-BSP combined they seale the fate of BJP. Even in general elections congress is fond of calling BJP 31% vote share Govt. So if all anti-Modi factions get together come together BJP will lose power on paper. That it has taken opposition 4 years to realize shows lack of strategy on their part. They will likely fall apart on the question of leadership, as congress will claim as their birth right. However, some parties has poor taste of association with congress. I believe, presently, only Sharad Pawar can act as glue as he is a good strategist. Unfortunately, he heads very small party. Another person is Chandrababu Naidu till recently BJP ally and will be kin to take revenge for alleged humiliation he suffered.But his political birth is on account of strong anti-congress feelings in Andhra. Possibly, leadership will be shared.       Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   I am BJP supporter and I will accept verdict of people. I am not going to say that we had a moral victory or something that sort of. I believe that the BJP lost due to following reasons : I think this losses would help BJP to be more serious and formulate a strategy to counter SP+BSP. This bypolls also proved that no one in India has the power to face BJP alone. But I would suggest that Rahul Gandhi should not be happy at all as his party lost deposits in both seats and it can dash his hopes to be PM as the regional parties are growing but his party has lost across India. RSS, VHP and BJP voters should also not be over confident over BJP's victory all the times and they should go out and vote. Image Source : HT.

But we must note that the Lenin Statue was built on private land by private people. These people themselves demolished the statue. Lenin has lost relevance in today‚Äôs world. He is not a saint or a great leader. He was responsible for killing of millions of innocent people in his home country of Russia. Lenin, Stalin, Mao killed almost same number of people killed by Hitler. communism theory talks about killing of innocent people to make a new society. It is Ok for communism to kill 10% of population to abolish the privileged class and bring equality in the society. The end of Indian communism may be very near. They destroyed the beautiful & progressive state of West Bengal. The writing is on the wall for communists. These were the same people who supported China during 1962 India-China war. Once Prakash Karat told (during debate on Nuclear Deal) it is their duty to stop India-US alliance against a fellow communist country China. These people have not been loyal to cause of India. They have ruled Tripura with iron hand and only communists supporter got benefit of their rule. One example- India has moved to 7th pay commission whereas Tripura is giving salary based on 4th pay commission. Lenin‚Äôs statue has fallen everywhere after the fall of communism like in Ukraine, Russia, Poland etc. It is quite natural that same thing would happen in Tripura. These same communists had vandalized statues of leaders like Indira Gandhi in Tripura during their rule and it is payback time.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Related Questions      Author has answers and answer views   Only in India, you can exercise your democratic rights to install statue of a dictator‚Ä¶ and cry ‚Äòfascism‚Äô when it is removed! :) Before beginning, let us see who is the person in discussion. Lenin is not a figure which was revered anywhere outside communist circles. Even communist find mass killings in Lenin‚Äôs regime difficult to explain. Stalin was a direct successor and a result of Lenin's ideology. He unleashed a terror bigger then Lenin. Lenin showed the path of brutal oppression to Stalin, by his own example. So Lenin was the root cause of terror which unleashed by Stalin. Victims of Lenin's ideology would be even higher than the direct killings done by him. No wonder, Many statues of Lenin have been frequently removed or even destroyed, even in Russia after fall of Soviet Union in 1991. In other places of world, the statues are kept but annually pained in funny ways (Comic book superheroes one year, bright pink next year and so on) just to make a statement against him. But such statues are revered in India! Today we cannot find Lenin's statue except a limited places of erstwhile soviet era‚Ä¶. and India of course! But why he should find support in India? Few people know that the founder of The Indian Communist Party in 1920, M. N. Roy actually met Lenin . The ideology of working for people seemed very appealing to him at that time. But soon Lenin showed his dark side and his brutal ways started to come in public attention. But Roy chose to ignore, even justify and to some extent even emulate that. Despite everything done by Lenin, Roy remained a member of the Lenin‚Äôs organisation for communists for eight years. Now, I must admit that I find Lenin's ideology (actually Marx‚Äôs ideology,communism in general) somewhat appealing. But problem is that only in an Utopian world we can see the ideology working on ground. It has done more harm to poor than any capitalistic ideology could ever do (Hint: Readers are advised to read Animal farm , which explains it beautifully by an allegory) So problem really was not so much in the ideology itself,but the ways taken to fulfill the ideology, to a large extent, the political killings by left wingers in India follow the precedent set by Lenin .  the party here should learn from party workers in West Bengal the methods of eliminating political rivals leaving no evidence. This alleged statement finds weight after we have benefit of hindsight to witness cases of killings and missing opponents of the communist party. Now coming to THE statue, The statue of Lenin was installed to celebrate 21 years of communist rule in Tripura, after winning the 2013 assembly elections. There are reports that local CPI(M) workers would regularly come and hold meetings in front of statue which would disrupt local people. But make no mistake, the act of dismantling the statue was totally unfortunate and should be highly condemned. The people who carried it out should be severely reprimanded. The clowns who carried it out, don't understand that they are not doing service to anyone by such knee-jerk acts. What drove those people to take such action, we don't know. Either they Certainly they didn't dismantle the statue to protest Lenin's ideology. I suspect if they even knew about Life and works of Lenin. If the accused (who have since been arrested) were really BJP workers, sooner BJP get rid of such people the better. We can make a wise our enemy, but never make a fool our friend. But equally amazing is the response of many Left supporters (and, amusingly, AAP workers, who never admit of following Leftist ideology in open!), even on Quora, they are comparing this To this Their logic could be accepted only if they also spoke a word during this, So they are selectively deaf about the things, and all their logic is applied to suit their motives. I would have accepted their concerns, In essence, Left supporters fail to look into mirror while they call others out, classic case of pot calling the kettle black. But media attention is very misplaced and they should have rather focused on the right issues. Sooner we stop talking about dead statues and start worrying about living people, the better. Footnotes                    I won‚Äôt go into a political debate of right or wrong here because I am the least qualified person to do that. But as someone from Tripura, I will definitely give my POV. The demolition of Lenin‚Äôs statue after BJP‚Äôs victory is a representative action. No, it has nothing to do with Lenin's ideology here. It represents arrogance. It represents intolerance. It represents the vandalism that is being carried out throughout the state. The destruction of public and private property, atrocities on people who have political inclinations different from BJP or RSS. I don‚Äôt care about Lenin‚Äôs statue. I can‚Äôt care less about Lenin‚Äôs statue actually when I am calling home thrice a day to check up on my parents, to tell my parents not to go out unless it is absolutely necessary, to tell my sister to stay in and keep my parents in. I am getting calls and messages from friends in other states asking me about the conditions in Tripura, asking if my parents are okay. I am calling up my friends and relatives to check if they are okay, if their locality has been safe. And none of them had anything to do with active politics ever! This is a conversation I had with a friend around 2 am on Sunday. And I have many other such conversations in the past two days. Me: What are you doing up so late at night? Him: Trying to maintain peace Me: How? Him: By helping the people of CPIM, guarding them. Me: What are you saying! Are conditions that bad? Him: There are people at my home too And these are friends who are as much away from politics as possible. They are good people who have been just and fair and peaceful but are now somehow caught in a shitstorm because they cannot see people getting beaten up because of their political inclination. If you check the local news of the state, you will see that in every part of the state this vandalism is going on. And I am worried that the people I care about might somehow get caught in the middle when things turn ugly. Am I paranoid? Might be. But these are people I love, this is a place, a state I call home. And it hurts to see things turning this way. CPIM didn‚Äôt work hard for the development of the state? Corruption was rampant? Unemployment high? I understand! I understand that people voted for BJP because they wanted change, they wanted development. And they believed BJP can bring that change. And I thought it was justified too. But is this the change they deserve? I was born in Tripura, I have grown up there. I was proud how peaceful the state have been all these years. We have had elections before too. Ideologically Congress and CPIM didn‚Äôt exactly see eye to eye either. But that didn‚Äôt call for demolition of statues, mass atrocities, vandalism. Because power before was not arrogant. They respected people, their property, their choices. But with BJP that changes. It was seen in other states, now it is happening in Tripura too. People who actually understand polarizing ideologies talk, debate, write, protest peacefully; they don‚Äôt go around vandalizing, beating up people. So no. Don‚Äôt tell me it is about ideologies. As someone from Tripura how I feel about it? I am fucking angry. I am disappointed. It is scary to see otherwise peaceful people being radicalized so easily and turned against each other. But I would lie if I said I am surprised. With BJP‚Äôs track record in other states and the divisive campaign they ran in the state, I would be pretty stupid to expect otherwise. And yeah, with friend and family in the state, I feel pretty helpless too.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   For Long and Till Yesterday Tripura remained the Bastion for Left ideology, A shift in democratic polity after the election changed the things overnight! coming to question! Democracy is indispensable to socialism. -Vladimir Lenin Its ironic, this same democracy gave the power to freshly elected helmsman and eventually got his statue removed in Tripura! Vladimir Lenin may seems irrelevant in current political situation of Tripura but the essence of his contribution still remains the centre piece for any democratic Government in the world.His differences over capitalism was born from his inclination towards proletariats or the working class. After the WWII and Economic crises Governments all over the world (barring few exceptions) transformed into , as they (Govts) found its a good course to have a Blend of both Capitalists and Communist influences in policy making. Thereby safe guarding the interest of both working class as well as capitalists by encouraging private industries as they are the key drivers of economy and generators of Employment. Its Unfortunate that Today‚Äôs Act was done under the disguise of Democracy to bury the legacy of 25 years Left Government which provided a fine leader with integrity like History could have been respected! As said by Tripura Governor Tathagata Roy! Everything is fair in Love and War! And Later this also Shows the Democratic Ethos of India! Transition of Power from one Democratically elected government to another! Its not a Rare incident of this kind occurred but statues of Lenin were . Hope it will not raise an Unrest and Peace prevails!           Author has answers and answer views   Looks like I am the second person from Tripura to write an answer on this thread. I will start with a little background. I was born and raised in Agartala and now live abroad for higher studies. Though I didn‚Äôt vote in the elections this year, I am in constant touch with my friends and family back home. Firstly, I‚Äôll start by mentioning that I am extremely overwhelmed by amount the coverage my state is getting. Probably most of us are not used to such exemplary coverage in mainstream (Indian and few international  ) and social media. So, much so that #BJPFightsLenin and #Tripura were top trending tags in India in last 24 hours of writing this answer. Prior to this, whenever I told people (Indians) that I come from Tripura, what I mostly got was a bewildered and inquisitive look. Usually, I gave them a quick geography lesson about the Northeast India. Funnily enough, now those people are giving me political science and history lessons (pertaining to Communist revolution in Russia). Secondly, coming to the point about how do I feel about demolishing of Lenin‚Äôs statue - this is aghast! I believe the statue was erected with approval from the local governing body and it is outright vandalism to bring it down without approval from the authorities. Without going into what is ideologically right and wrong, time and again, we have seen that mob violence did more harm than good. To update you, another Lenin statue has been brought down . Also, to give you an idea, a good part of Tripura and parts of West Bengal are studded with statues and roads commemorating famous communist leaders. A road called ‚ÄúLenin Sarani‚Äù runs across the heart of capital city, Agartala. If people want to change it, fine! but do it in a proper way! Thirdly, I am also disappointed to see the hue and cry over the demolishing of a statue, where the ambiance of the state isn‚Äôt very positive. There can not be absolute denial of the fact that people who had allegiance to CPI(M) are being attacked, harassed and mishandled by a section of people. Although, the post-election violence isn‚Äôt something unheard of, but the scale this time puzzles me. A section of the society are overjoyed and others are terrified. There is absolutely no middle ground. This is something alarming to me. Following is a screenshot of a conversation in our school Whatsapp group: Friend 1: My uncle isn‚Äôt going to his office. People have been throwing stones at their home. This is the change they are bringing. If I turn to Congress tomorrow, they will even start to beat me. Its just a few goons are doing that. Friend 2: Post election violence isn‚Äôt something new. Earlier it was CPM cadre, this time its BJP. Friend 3: So how is BJP better than the earlier guys? At least, they (CPM) did not go this low. Friend 2: Even one of my uncle‚Äôs place have been targeted for stone pelting. Friend 3: O F**k! Ask him not to go there. I consider myself and my family to be rather politically unaligned to any political party and have been neither vocal supporter nor critic of any side. Even then, when I talk to my father now, he clearly sounds concerned about what is happening. To the newly elected government of Tripura: Congratulations! I look forward to work together for the next five years towards our common goal. In the meantime, I would request you take a note of the unrest in the state and take action against the concerned people. Peace! Footnotes         Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   I was supremely happy when I saw pictures of the demolition of the statue of this arch-traitor and arch-tyrant. Who was Vladimir Lenin ? He was supposedly a ‚ÄúGreat Revolutionary‚Äù who established a dictatorship after the dissemination of his wholly utopian ideas which were never practical to begin with and received active help from the Kaiser‚Äôs Government in Germany during WWI when the Russian Armies where battling the German armies on the Eastern Front. He was shipped in a sealed boxcar to Petrograd, Russia in a train which travelled across German territory from Zurich in Switzerland and started a revolution in Russia which toppled the Czar and took Russia out of the war. In short he and his ‚Äúrevolutionaries‚Äù stabbed the Russian army in the back and toppled the monarchy while at the same time signing the treaty of Brest-Litovsk which gave away large parts of Western Russia to Germany, Austria Hungary and Turkey See the map below to see the large areas of Russian territory which Lenin and his Bolsheviks just signed away to the Central powers before pulling Russia out of World War I. The Bolsheviks and the German delegation signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. Here the Bolsheviks agreed to pay six billion Gold in compensation to German interests for German losses on the Eastern Front. After toppling the Czar and murdering the Czar‚Äôs entire family in a basement in the city of Yekaterinburg, east of the Ural Mountains, Lenin setup a Marxist dictatorship which used absolute and unrelenting terror as its mode of governance - systematically murdering all opponents and establishing sweeping surveillance. In the end, bad Karma always begets a horrible death. Vladimir Lenin, the Russian revolutionary and architect of the Soviet Union, died from syphilis caught from a Parisian prostitute and not from a stroke as has always been believed, new research has claimed. Stalin, Lenin‚Äôs successor continued this murderous legacy after a power struggle which murdered scores of rivals and which killed 30 million Soviet citizens from the years 1925 to 1953. Stalin‚Äôs monstrous record was surpassed by Mao who also happens to be a hero to our totally inane Communists in India. Mao murdered 50 million people if you include the casualties of the Korean war. The treacherous Indian Communists seem to forget that Mao‚Äôs forces attacked India in 1962 and started a political partnership with our rival in the sub-continent - Pakistan which has been continued by his successors to this day. Mao had a little competition from - Pol-Pot who murdered a third of Cambodia‚Äôs population, Castro, the Korean Kims were not far behind in perpetuating this murderous record. The Eastern European Communist countries and Cuba have all experienced dictatorships foisted by this harrowing and murderous ideology. What has communism given mankind ? I can only think of three things. Atrocious Lies, Mass Murders and Total Surveillance. When I saw the happy and triumphant people of Tripura tear down the statue of this tyrant, a flood of relief and indescribable happiness filled my heart. MORE POWER to the PEOPLE OF TRIPURA ! These very scenes were repeated in several counties in Eastern Europe in 1989. To those puerile idiots who compare the pulling down of Lenin‚Äôs statue with the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban, I can only ascribe the Communist habit of drawing atrociously false comparisons for this. WHERE IS BUDDHA who taught PEACEFUL MEDITATION and FORBEARANCE..and whose statues in Bamiyan were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site‚Ä¶ and WHERE IS LENIN, the mass-murdering sociopath whose corpse is neither buried nor cremated and whose statues were torn down all across Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism If a statue of Jiten Paul had stood in the place of that sordid mass murderer Lenin, then I am sure that the people of Tripura would not have pulled it down. Who is Jiten Paul ? One may ask. Jiten Paul took part in India‚Äôs independence movement in Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh where he was born. He brought out Tripura‚Äôs first Bengali daily 'Jagaran' in 1953 Jiten Paul, was a veteran journalist and freedom fighter, who passed away some years ago at a hospital in Agartala, at age of 101. With his demise, a brilliant legacy of journalism and social movement in Northeast India came to an end. To those communists who are protesting the pulling down of Lenin‚Äôs statue in Agartala, as a ‚ÄúFascistic assault on Indian Democracy ‚Äú I have only these words. Get a life you imbeciles !

But I Loved it! Lenin is neither an Indian nor a Saint. He is no less than Hitler. There is nothing about him worth Respecting. This Quote may give you some idea about this Monster. ‚ÄúOne man with Gun can control hundred without One.‚Äù Vladimir Lenin Still not satisfied? Ok. Now, have a look at this image.  They are Ukrainians demolishing Lenin's statue in Kiev. They are the people who have Suffered a lot due to him. They know who is Real Vladimir Lenin beyond the Soviet Propaganda. They know him much better than Spineless Communists of India. They are not fools. Thousands of Ukrainians lost their lives due to him. Everytime the Ukrainians saw this statue, they were reminded of the oppression suffered by their ancestors. It was a symbol of oppression laughing at them everyday & the only way to get rid of him was demolishing his statue. During the 1990s more than 2,000 Lenin monuments were demolished in Galicia and Volyn, at the turn of the 1990-2000s more than 600 Lenin monuments were removed in western and central areas, in 2005-2008 more than 600 were demolished mainly in central areas, and in 2013-2014 552 monuments were demolished. Demolishing of Lenin's Statue is a Popular phenomenon across Post Communist States. It is so common that actually there is a term for it in Ukraine called Leninopad(–õ–µ–Ω—ñ–Ω–æ–ø–∞–¥), a pun literally translated as ""Leninfall"".  It took People of Tripura 25 Years to realise this. But finally they toppled down Communism along with it's symbols of oppression. I support the people of Tripura in their fight against this Oppressive and anti-Indian ideology. Malaria is treated by Quinine & Communism is treated by Leninopad. You can learn to perform Leninopad from this YouTube Tutorial Video. Perform Leninopad & Save Lives!

Author has answers and answer views   What are the views of Tripura people on the statue of Lenin being demolished after the BJP‚Äôs victory? (Disclaimer : I am not from Tripura, but I think so are the others who have answered this question before me!) Answer requested. Thanks and . I am very least concerned with Lenin, or even the Communist Party of India, or Tripura where the BJP had recently won a well deserved handsome victory in the elections, but will focus entirely on the act of a jubilant mob pulling down a sundry statue in a public space. And when Altaf called it Vandalism, I can not but agree. There can not be a better word to describe such acts of demolition or destruction of public property for political reasons. It is pure and simple Vandalism, and by a motivated mob. But then, what one can logically expect from a political outfit which practically paved its own path to power in most of the States and the Center with the stones from another monument similarly vandalized and destroyed?  With just this one vandalism, a winning formula was born. Fundamentalism and fanaticism, of whatever religion- Hindu,Islam, Christian or Jew- or ideology - be it Leftist or Rightist - can find manifestation of and fulfillment only in destruction and vandalism.  The question here is not of whether it is Buddha or Lenin whose statue was destroyed, and by whom, Islamist Talibans or an inebriated with power Right Wing mob, but it is this act of vandalism as a celebration of victory is the surest sign of decadence and danger. And more importantly this appears to signal a new trend or trail in the political ethos of the country. Otherwise how are we going to reconcile this happening in the North-eastern corner of the country immediately finding a ready resonance thousands of kilometers away in the southern most state of Tamilnadu?  So, Comrades or Mitron, politics and governments can either be about actual construction or token destruction, either about ‚Äòvikas‚Äô or vandalism, but unfortunately the choice right now does not seem to be in our hands.

"Textised! : Why did the BJP lose the recent by-elections in UP? - Quora,

",textise_quora,"   The latest Textise blog post talks about . It would really help if you could complete the polls!  The original page address was https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-BJP-lose-the-recent-by-elections-in-UP For sharing use http://tinyurl.com/yd4ku983 Here are some options: | | This page may be out of date.    .   Sign In Quora uses cookies to improve your experience.      Answer Wiki  Answers       Author has answers and answer views   Normally, the ruling party tends to win by-elections as people do not vote for an opposition party and making themselves ineffective in the process. Unless they have an anger against the ruling party which they want to demonstrate. Here it is even more strange that the seats were vacated by the CM and Deputy CM, and Gorakhpur was held by Yogi for over 19 years. So, it is a shocking defeat. Yogi has cited over-confidence as the main reason. Perhaps. That the electoral arithmetic will work was probably not reckoned. If we get into a little statistics of voting, BJP has got 3% more votes than what it polled in the state assembly elections, though a lot lesser than the percentage of votes in the 2014 Lok sabha election. But it is the combined vote share of BSP and SP that saw them through. Only to prove a point that the Mahagathbandhan of the sort experimented successfully in Bihar is applied to UP, it can be a different story for BJP in 2019. Proves the ugly point that Indian electorate have not risen above caste politics totally. So, BJP needs allies for sure and needs a wave to sail them through 2019. The only positive is TINA factor.       Related Questions        Originally Answered:  A high IOU (Index of opposition unity.) When ever a party in power acquires a modicum of invincibility, all opposition parties pool up their resorces , forgetting their seperate agendas and fight unitedly the ruling party. The degree of their combined might is determined by quality of their unity . In UP it was obvious that unless SP and BSP hang together , most assuredly they shall be hanged seperately by BJP. Having tasted significant success, will the combo continue in future is anybody's guess , as they are not natural allies. BJP's biggest loss is not a couple of Parliament seats, but the Invincibilty halo that was around Modi-Shah combo. Good show by Congress in Modi's home turf Gujarat, BJPs recent losses in Rajasthan and now in Yogi's back yard Gorakhpur are clear indicators that 2019 show is very unlikely to be as spectacular as 2014 performance for BJP . With regional allies of BJP flexing their muscles , We are likely to witness intersting times in the run up to 2019 Mahabharath. One can safely assume that 2019 Finale will be as riveting as any of Bollywood's block buster's jaw dropping climax.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   Many of my relatives live in Uttar Pradesh. I am familiar with the ground reality there. This is exam season and most of the students and their parents in UP are furious. Yogi‚Äôs strict administration has ensured that organized cheating is absent this time. Now, many students may fail. This is how Power supply works in UP : But all that extra power means increased bills, crackdown on the power thieves, installation of meters. So, obviously many people aren‚Äôt happy with that. BJP kept its promise of loan waivers to farmers. But the farmers are not satisfied for some reason, specially the potato and sugarcane farmers who are not getting right prices for their yields. The road construction in the rural areas and even a few urban areas is happening at double the pace in comparison to SP‚Äôs time, but the corruption in these projects is under check. The local contractors are not at all happy with that. Before Yogi took office, UP was a safe haven for local thugs and other mafia, but now in the last year alone, there have been thousands of raids, hundreds of encounters, and hundreds of voluntary surrenders. When such illegal activities are curtailed, people lose their source of income. All the bureaucrats and government servants are in distress. Now, they have to come on time, leave on time, register in their bio-metric attendance. The work pressure is significantly higher now. In SP‚Äôs time, the OBCs (specially the Yadavs) used to magically grab every top government seat, clear every interview, get promoted with bullet speed. In BSP‚Äôs time, the same used to happen to people from some other caste. Now, everything is fair and open. It's natural that people from those castes never have and never will vote against SP or BSP. Caste based politics is here to stay in UP. Also, the unfortunate outbreak of Encephalitis and subsequent death of children didn‚Äôt help the BJP in Gorakhpur, where the by-elections were held. All these people hold a grudge against the current government there, maybe they are right, maybe they are wrong. A lot of them voted for the BJP last year, but didn‚Äôt come out to vote this time. But since the opposition parties united this time, the division of votes, which were cast against the BJP didn‚Äôt happen and that hurt the BJP. But I won‚Äôt consider this the general mood of the entire state. People are mostly happy with the Yogi government. A satisfied voter doesn‚Äôt come out to vote, specially if it‚Äôs a by-poll. That explains the low voter turn out. If there were to be assembly elections in UP today, BJP would still be the single largest party, despite SP and BSP having joined hands.             Nobody can understand equations of UP politics, if He isn‚Äôt a localite & haven‚Äôt played games of politics in UP. The main reason of loss of BJP is low voter turn-out, It‚Äôs said about UP that all the votes polled after 45% goes to BJP. In UP whole voting procedure flows according to caste lines. SP votes- Yadavs, Muslims & Candidate‚Äôs caste-mates. BSP-SC/ST (Jaatav only), Muslims & Candidate‚Äôs caste-mates. BJP- Upper Caste, SC/ST (Non-Jaatav), Maurya, Kurmi, Jaat & Candidate‚Äôs caste-mates. UP is a state where more than 90% youths & labourers live outside their assembly seats, for education, Job & better living.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?      Author has answers and answer views   Let me tell you the absolute reality. Everyone will keep saying that this is because of SP+BSP alliances or people lost faith in Modi JI or Yogi JI is not up to his promises to the people of UP. Complete wrong information. In UP we all are with Yogi JI, he is the best CM we have ever got and we still have full even more faith in Narendra Modi. So what happens in by-election?????? The only reason for BJP defeat in UP by-election: Gorakhpur turned out to be only 47% votes and Phulpur even worst turned out to be only 37% voting. In Phulpur SP+BSP candidate won with a margin of around 59000 votes and in Gorakhpur, SP+BSP candidate won by a margin of only 24000 votes. (You can see less voting % in Phulpur = More margin for SP+BSP) So if it would have been even 55% voting, I can bet both BJP candidate were going to win by a margin of at least 1 lakh votes. The fact in UP is Muslims (SP core vote bank) and Dalit (BSP core vote bank), they never forget votes. Least interested community in giving votes is General category like Brahmin, Rajput‚Äôs, and Thakurs (BJP core vote bank). (My mother cast her vote first time in 2014 when I told her that she has go, she used to say my single vote is not going to make any difference for BJP) but Dalit and Muslims don‚Äôt think like this, voting for them is like a festival (Kudos to all). So out of this 47% in Gorakhpur and 37% in Phulpur SP+BSP got most of their votes as their vote bank showed an active interest in by-poll voting but BJP voters did not take it seriously and half of them did not even cast their votes. Hence BJP lost. I can bet my head on this, in 2019 when the voting % will be 55-60%, BJP is going to win both seats back by a margin of at least 1 lakh votes. Even if it is SP+BSP+Congress+anyother = BJP. It is the ground reality:             Now Let me told the truth after all BJP IT CELL workers have wiped the ass of BJP‚Ä¶.I live in Uttar Pradesh and i am a regular voter of BJP‚Ä¶.The reason BJP loose in recent BY POLLS of UP and others :- 1JAITLIE worst ecnomic policies,no relief to middle and salary class,also the tax price and petrol price in increasing like Hell 2.Demonetization failure to curb Black money 3.Poor Implementation of GST and harassement of traders and businessperso 4.

Your response is private. Is this answer useful?        In Gorakhpur there was a divide in BJP. Yogi Ji's candidate was kept aside. Candidate was not even from Gorakhnath Math. People of Gorakhpur has their emotional sentiments attached with math. Would if someone from Math was given the ticket,figures would be different. Whereas Phulpur was never a safe seat. Overall conclusion is BJP didn't took these elections seriously.           Author has answers and answer views   Originally Answered:  BJP lost , because the timing of by-election is grossly wrong.Both Yogiji and KP Mourya will lose today even if they contest in person.There is no point in blaming SP-BSP combine.They both should have immediately vacated their MP seats,once they took the charge in UP the swing of assembly tempo,voters were in mood to vote BJP.Therefore,BJP could have retained both seats.Now after one year, deficiencies and shortfalls of BJP rule have come out.Yogiji begged for votes.But voters were already in mood to teach a lesson to both.

Answer Wiki  Answers       Author has answers and answer views   Simple reason BJP doesn't understand the people's sentiments. As a party who is looking to establish their foundation in a difficult state to win they need to understand the culture of that state and respect the feelings of that particular state. This is what BJP has failed to do so far. Things like imposing Hindi in Tamilnadu is a disastrous idea for BJP. It's not that we are reluctant to speak Hindi but it's at a point where you are trying to degrade our Mother tongue. For BJP to succeed in Tamilnadu they need to win the hearts of the people, not by going against their sentiments. And the state leaders also need to understand this and report to the top management on how and what measures that are needed to be taken to understand the people's sentiments here. Moreover such questions in Quora like Should we kick Tamilnadu out of India, Hindi imposition, Are Tamils are Hindus will further decrease BJP‚Äôs political gain in Tamilnadu.

Related Questions      Author has answers and answer views   Why can't BJP win in Tamil Nadu? In politics perceptions are more important than reality. BJP in Tamil Nadu is seen a party of the Northern Indian who wish to impose Hindi, and the north Indian culture on the Tamilians. Tamilians are not only proud of their language but also proud of their culture. The hooliganism indulged by the BJP cadres, wherever the party is in power in the north puts Tamilians off. South Indians in general and Tamilians in particular are sticklers of an orderly conduct. The unruly behaviour indulged by the workers in the name of cow vigilantism, moral policing, is not liked by these folks. South Indians do not hold the same regressive attitude towards women as is the norm in the North. The bulldozing of the statue of Lenin in Tripura even before the BJP government has been sworn in, has upset the people no end, and the face book post of a Tamilnadu BJP leader that they would do the same with the statue of the Periyar (though the post was later removed after a storm broke over it) has revealed the total lack of tolerance by the party. The tweet of the Governor of Tripura virtually endorsing the toppling of the statue of Lenin has increased the unease. So if the party fails to add Tamilnadu to the BJP ruled states, the blame shall lie with the party.             Solely because of its state leadership. Period We cannot even show a single BJP leader in Tamil Nadu who speaks about development rather than pro hindutva ideas. Religion appeasement won‚Äôt work out in Tamil Nadu as it happens in other part of the country. If they change their approach and speak about developmental stuffs , they stand a chance.           Author has answers and answer views   This refers to Gaurav Tyagi. Who said Tamil people are protective of their culture. ? A strong No. EVR was a Kannadiga who declared ‚ÄúTamil‚Äù as a BARBARIC LANGUAGE. STILL ALL THE DRAVIDIAN PARTIES CALL HIM AS ‚ÄúTHANTHAI"" MEANING FATHER. MGR was a malayalee. He was most respected Chief Minister who ruled for 13 years. Karunanidhi's forefathers migrated from Andhra Pradesh. Karunanidhi's actual name is Dakshinamurthy. He is the celebrated poet in Tamil. Vaiko, vijaykanth have Telugu ancesters. They are treated as heroes here. What aboutTamil Cinema. Most of the Heroes and heroines are NOT FROM TAMILNADU. Still they are loved and earning crores. In short Tamilnadu is like United States which is called as the land of immigrants. Here every tom dick and Harry can rule the roost. In the same vein anti good principles are steadily loosing steam.Tamilnadu will sooner or later opt for non DRAVIDIAN parties as they are fed up this DRAVIDIAN parties. We have to see whether Kamal or Rajini could make some impact. Why BJP could also step in.           Author has answers and answer views   Recently, MK Stalin said that he wasn't opposed to the concept of Dravida Nadu. MK Stalin is the leader of the DMK. He said it because he feels that his idea atleast has some support. The BJP can't enter and win in TN because its opposed to Dravida Nadu as a rule. This is the same reason as to why the INC can't win. If TN‚Äôs politicians talk about Dravida Nadu, then i think that no national party can win there. Because National Parties are opposed to any concept of Dravida Nadu. The issue isn't BJP‚Äôs supposed Hindi Imposition, because no national party has come to power in TN from the 1970s regardless of its stance on Hindi.           Author has answers and answer views   It's obvious BJP will never win in TN. For almost six decades Tamilians have been brainwashed in to believing that they are the original Dravidians and Tamil Brahmins are the Aryan invaders from the North! Pure bull! And so, anyone or anything from North is made to be seen, by the great Tamil politicians, as a threat to Dravidian culture! I can't believe, just because i am a Brahmin, I am anti Tamil. How absurd! With such a prevailing mindset do you think BJP will ever win in TN. No way!           Author has answers and answer views   I don't agree with the point that BJP can't win in TN. It will take time but BJP is the only party from all the otger non Tamil origin parties that can come close and might even form government in TN. Why they are not able to it is simply because they don't have strong leaders in TN. They lack faces that TN people can relate to. TN people are very protective of their culture. An outside face is the last thing they look for in a party. This the only point only regional parties have a stronghold in the state of TN. There are three things that unite Indians Cricket, Movies and BJP. For them or against them is a different story all together.      View More Related Questions Still have a question? Ask your own!

Because Loksabha polls will be fought on entirely different level and it will be Modi vs the rest. Infact I think these losses have come at a right time for BJP to introspect working at ground level.

Is this answer useful?        Assuming you are talking about 2 Rajasthan bypolls, 2 MP bypolls and State Election in Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. Situations are diffrent in each case. In nearly all of these election people knew who was going to win. Rajasthan - BJP was bound to lose here because of heavy anti-incumbency against Vasundhra Raje and these seats were Congress stronghold before 2014 election. MP - The 2 MLA seats were also congress stronghold. These seats come under Guna Parliament constituencies which are Jyotiraditya Scindia‚Äôs Stronghold. In 2014 election Guna and Chindwara were only LS seats won by Congress. Even then the margin of victory was 2000 and 8000 which was previouly 25k+ and 30k+ respectively. I wont be surprised if the margin was bigger. Another thing is that in these states there are only two major parties (INC & BJP). So Anti-Government vote directly goes in favour of opposition party. For Election in Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya, Do your own analysis.           Author has answers and answer views   Why is BJP losing in bypolls? BJP is a major national political party of India. It has madate of 31% of 70% of 100 % voters of India who are above the voting age. The voters of BJP are based in urban cities of Hindi belt. The rural people living in villages of Hindi belt are not dominant voters . The recent bypolls held in Hindi belt of Rajasthan and now in Madhya Pradesh , is an alarming sign for BJP that the Hindu voters are not happy with the performance of BJP. It also means that what the BJP Ministers and leaders claim on debates is not acknowledged by voters through their votes. The voters outside urban areas want jobs and good prices for their agricultural produce. If these two needs are fulfilled, than in their surplus times, they would engage in pursuit of gods and Hindutva. People wants to know more on material progress and not spiritual. The agenda of the BJP has been everything than this. When you are hungry and thirsty, the issues such as Hindu Nationalism, integral humanism, two nation theory, racism, casteism, national freedom movement, constitution, Tricolour, integration of minorities in native culture, temple and so on, don't matter. The bypolls in Hindi belt are like avalanche, slowly gathering into big mountain. The BJP‚Äùs gaining new grounds in border areas of North East India looks that the voters there are impressed by RSS Chief's recent remark that their cadre can perform soldierly role. It may so happen that in next general elections, the Hindu belt may shift to border areas. Whether it is punishment posting or graceful assignment, only time will tell.

Author has answers and answer views   I contemplated on this for a long time yesterday when BJP won in Tripura big time. After losing by polls in Rajasthan and MP the media had said that Modi‚Äôs chances in 2019 were going bleaker day by day. Then Tripura happened and the same media said Modi is invincible. I knew right away the By-poll results are not a test of Modi‚Äôs popularity. The following are the reasons I have come up with for the BJP to lose in bypolls: Thank you for reading, do consider sharing and bookmarking for future reference! Bhat Saheb Hey there! If we haven‚Äôt met before, I am Anirudh. I write on Politics, NEET-UG, Goa and much more. Do pay a visit to:            Author has answers and answer views   Why is BJP loosing (sic) in bypolls? Anti-incumbency. One can observe that in recent days BJP has been losing by elections in states where the party is in power. BJP could win even in Gujarat, the backyard of Prime Minister Modi ji, only after a protracted battle and with reduced majority. This is true not only for BJP, but to most political parties. SP lost in UP, SAD in Punjab and Congress in Himachal. If exit polls are to be believed, even CPM may be losing its stranglehold in Tripura. In the present information driven age and increased awareness of people, political parties have to worry more about this anti- incumbency than even their opponents. Voters can no longer be taken for granted.      Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer useful?        In my humble opinion, BJP is losing in bye polls because people have realised that they are not focussing on real growth, job creation, farmer upliftment etc., the things which matter. Hence they are rejecting BJP in bye polls, specially where is it in power. And BJP is winning new states on a streak because those states are unaware or the BJP rule‚Äôs reality and are convinced by their PR machinery. If any state, for example Tripura who recently went to poll is given a chance for re-election, there is a chance that BJP won‚Äôt form govt or at least their vote share will decrease. I think what happened in Tripura would have made people realise they made a mistake. Similarly people of US realised when they chose Trump and Britishers realised when they voted marginally in favour of Brexit. Post Brexit survey indicate this. So, the next chance they get to vote BJP out, they cling to it, hence their loss in bye polls. In Haryana, if you would have asked anyone, after 1‚Äì2 years of BJP rule, if they think BJP would return to power, most would have said no. So, unless the BJP change its functioning and focus on job creation, agriculture upliftment, arresting fraudsters, it is very likely that the results of bye polls will be repeated in 2019. If they mend their ways, there is hope for them.      View More Related Questions Still have a question? Ask your own!
