', ' new delhi as the congress party today accused the bjp of stealing peoples private information the latter responded by calling the congress president rahul gandhi technologically illiterate.  bjp was reacting to congress presidents charges accusing the modi government of stealing users data shared on the  namo.  rahuls allegations are a classic case of technological illiteracy. he does not know that data analysis is not equivalent to spying. this new age is the age of information which rahul ji will not understand bjp spokesperson said in a press conference.    prior to patras allegations congress leader in a press conference had called the narendra modi government data leak sarkar and accused it of leaking peoples data by asking them to submit their personal information on the namo app.    modi government is attacking the privacy of its citizens. abki baar data leak sarkar singhvi said.  referring to the recent scam by jeweller nirav modi and mehul choski singhvi slammed the government saying that not only is the peoples money in banks but their identities too are unsafe.  singhvi also accused the prime minister of snooping on minors by asking them to download the namo app in his book the exam warriors.  mr modi urged children to download namo app in his book exam warriors does he now want to snoop in on minors asked singhvi.  responding to the allegations that the congress partys with inc app was also sharing the users data with a firm in singapore the congress leader said that unlike bjp the supporters of his party use offline means to connect with the party.  the with inc app had  downloads our people preferred offline memberships. with inc app meant for people only interested to be our members while modis namo app has  lakh downloads by ordinary common people. we are not a missed call party like the bjp singhvi added.  an hour later patra in a press conference said that the users data shared by the namo app was as per the requirements of a smart app.  analysis is not equal to snooping or survellience. this is a provision of a smart app. namo app is no different from any smart app. like all the smart app it too requires the users to grant access to their personal data to help enhance the user experience patra said.  both the parties have been trading allegations over the use of users data shared on the mobile apps of their respective parties.  on saturday the congress targeted the namo app for alleged data sharing with a usbased firm. earlier today the bjp hit back at the congresss allegation accusing the latter of doing the same with its app with inc.    ', ' the bsps close ties with the samajwadi party are not for any selfish motive but in the national interest mayawati said emphasising that the opposition parties will have to work jointly to stop the bjp from coming to power at the centre. lucknow accusing the of seeking to drive a wedge into the newfound bonhomie between her party with the  bahujan samaj party chief on monday said the two parties friendship has been forged in national interest and not to meet any selfish end. the s close ties with the samajwadi party are not for any selfish motive but in the national interest she said emphasising that the opposition parties will have to work jointly to stop the bjp from coming to power at the centre.  she said the nonbjp parties should come together to address the problems suffered by the common people including the poor and the youth because of the wrong policies of the bjpled central and state governments.  mayawati said the bspsp friendship is also being welcomed all over the country.  the bsp and the sp workers will not fall prey to the bjps designs in the interest of the nation and the people as we along with all opposition parties will have to definitely stop them from coming to power at the centre this time.  since the bjp is now finding this tieup taking shape their leaders are issuing unfounded statements against the bspsp relationship she said days after the understanding between the two arch rivals came in for sharp criticism from the saffron party which lost key lok sabha bypolls in gorakhpur and phulpur to the sp.  the bsp supremo also referred to prime minister narendra modis remarks on dalit icon and chairman of the constitutiondrafting committee dr in his man ki baat programme yesterday and termed it as an eyewash.  in the past four years of their governance they have been continuously indulging in theatrics on issues related to dalits and backwards and any more drama on the issue will not get them any political mileage she said.  the country based on the principle of equality of dr bhimrao ambedkar can never be a reality under the government led by the bjp and the rss as their mindset is narrow communal and casteist which is against the very spirit of the constitution she said.  because of such a mentality people had kept it out of power for so long and now under the bjp government dalits and backwards are lagging behind she said adding that the benefits of the mandal commission recommendations have been made ineffective by the government just like the reservation for dalits.

some notable initiatives . misses pathankot attack the attack at iaf air base just few hours from the national capital is the first of its kind after the  mumbai attacks. there were differences of opinion over the way in which the encounter was handled home minister rajnath singh at the time of attacks and to make things worse there was confusion over the number if terrorists sneaked in to carry out the attack. the attack raised questions on the securitylevel at indias military bases. masood azhar indias efforts to add the name of masood azhar the chief of jem in the un list of

up with a thinktank approach to economic strategy. the acronym national institution for transforming india itself invited criticism of government pushing prohindi agenda and opposition ridiculing it

were introduced in the last two years.. in addition the government has relaunched kisan vikas patra and introduced a ppfequivalent for girl child the sukanya samriddhi scheme. again in country known from socialist welfare schemes the onus of welfare shifting from government to individual is an ideological change and may take time for acceptance.               politicians and diapers must be changed often and for the same reason  mark twain this saying of mark twain is full of arrogance but if we go beyond it we can see that they are sensible and practical words. congress came to power in  and brought phenomenal growth which is more than what bjpnda has managed till yet under the nda gdp growth was good in  as well. you can see that except year onset of the global financial crisis we were skyrocketing to greatness. then came the scams but one important observation to made here is this although the g and other scams broke out people voted again for the upa. why  because they were delivering in governance but growth slowed down as all the countries we were trading with got screwed because of the financial crisis and our software sector had no clients to make software for and growth became dismal and the scams werent tolerable anymore. like twain said the congress had become shtty. a young and ambitious country felt that this sluggishness is not for them. a vibrant positive and supersonic economy is what was demanded. enter narendra damodardas modi two years after bjp reign they have taken a no nonsense approach. all these initiatives are the right direction but by now youd forgot mark twains quote. the bjp will also become shtty over time and we will need to change them at which point we ll need a namo like man to take us forward. are they even different  the two parties have identical economic ideologies. both are neoliberal and market friendly and procapitalist in the st century. their ideologies differ socially inc is secular bjp is hindu nationalist. but this doesnt matter actually because our society is greatly influenced by people and not by political parties. so i conclude that both parties do good work for the progress of the nation and lose track along the way and this is only human. so we need to keep them in check without any bias towards any party. p.s. my opinion is null and void if rahul gandhi is the pm candidate for  in which case please dont vote congress.             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  the major difference between bjp and inc government is that it has been   years that narendra modi and bjp have been ruling the india and even till now we are still discussing the scams of inc  scams only. till date not even  scam has projected against bjp or its leaders.             author has answers and answer views   in democracy all political party has drawbacks. because parties are made of people and all people are not same. people are not perfect so arent the parties. but some are better than other. but with time and leadership it changes. once people thought congress was better so they ruled over  years. now people thinks bjp is better so bjp is ruling. so is bjp is better than congress  i wont put it in that way. i would say bjps functioning is better than congress right now. bjp has a better leader than congress. bjps inner architecture is more democratic than congress. right now congress has more flaws than bjp. but it does not mean bjp doesnt have any flaws. but if i put it straight in current situation india needs bjp more than congress. reason for me i like bjp because it has guts to take any decisions. and i personally think able to take any decision is the best quality any person can have. as decisions result could be good or bad. you are free to have different opinion. thank you jay hind             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  comparison of congress and bjp governments.             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  interesting question thanks for aa. i believe if congress sheds dynastic politics and start representing majority it will prove to be much better party than bjp. reason is simple  india was built by congress  in s it was competing with china the quality of talent and politicians produced by congress party still form backbone of this country. all institutions are built by congress congress made sure deprived had a voice in traditionally feudalistic society which has made this countrys foundation strong although rich dont like it. however after rajiv gandhi congress kept slipping from its core principles and post liberalisation it became too corrupt narsimha rao did hold it together but still it wasnt the same national force as it was once. this along with bjps pro hindu stance paved way for regional parties as well as bjp to fill leadership void. idealogically bjp has conservative roots and will not appeal to a significant diversity of the country. they will have to prove themselves. during  years of atal biharis government it was still a moderate bjp. however now its becoming aggressive absolute in power and execution which might spoil the diversity or community relations in the country. while that is definitely advantageous but its a known fact in history that absolute power corrupts. so i will not be surprised if bjp promises are not met until  or . this will call for dissent and so its possible bjp will try to block dissenters early on. we can already see that with many examples bashing of news reporters resignation of ias officers governess evm hacks paid media industry government nexus demonetization aadhar linking to taxes  mandatory. independence of judiciary  judge appointments. sidelining of old bjp members.all roads to gaining power are being checked and monitored thoroughly these are not good signs unless there is a positive strategy behind it. i have my doubts though. so they will still manage their vote bank and power with majoritarian controls. that only works for so long as party is able to hold all stakeholders together which is very difficult in india. only indira gandhi was able to do it in tough times and times will get tougher going forward. overall bjp has the required strength and power to govern but has no talent or experience to strike the right balance. if governance is what they intend to do. congress has all the talent  experience but no leadership or power anymore. also with scams and corruption they have lost credibility. in current situation bjp deserves a chance as they are the only ones capable of bringing much desired progress or good governance to this country.              author has answers and answer views   originally answered  q  which government is better congress or bjp a  subjective  good for whom and bad for whom keeping aside the chunavi jumme and preelection slogans also i would say that bjp government is much better. unfortunately the word achhe din has been misunderstood as saste din or muft din where all the farmers will get excellent price for the product the mercantile agents get excellent commission and the buyer also the product very cheap. moreover all the loans get a waiver. is is ever possible indians are not ready to tolerate short term pain for long term gain and want every thing within the very first term of modi. is it possible in a country like india i do understand and appreciate that many nonissues are deliberately being made issues during bjp regime  yoga sanskrit language geeta etc. and that is the reasons why such issues come up. disclosure  i am not a modi bhakt but just a student of politics and economics.      ', 'i am a kannadiga living in karnataka. so i think i can answer this. congress rule since  has been pathetic. so naturally they will be facing antiincumbency. this will help bjp as jds has its presence limited to old mysore region. also bjp has a trump card narendra modi. amit shahs efforts will be another big positive for bjp. just that state leaders doesnt mess up things like ticket distribution most unlikely as amit shah will be concentrating full time on karnataka. as the question is about bjp i am going to analyze district wise from bjps perspective north karnataka can be divided into two as northeast karnataka and northwest karnataka. let me start with northwest karnataka as the constituency number  nippani is from this region. northwest karnataka kittur karnataka or

ground reality has already answered in this thread. i just want to have a look in the near future. i have stayed in karnataka for  and half years left only in march. so i have a little bit idea about that state. so bjp will win.              author has answers and answer views   originally answered  yes it can and it will in karnataka in . reasons for it   modi wave  this is perhaps the biggest reason for the probable bjp win in karnataka. there is modi fever going on in the country and people are voting for him and not bjp.  anti incumbency  there is an anti incumbency sentiments among people regarding the current government which will benefit bjp.  three way contest  whenever three party are in fray bjp always wins like it did in delhiup and assam. similarly in karnataka there is contest between bjp congress and jds.  switch over  the other party members like sm krishna are switching over to bjp and some other congress and jds members are also joining bjp which will help them.            i would answer what will bjp need to do win in karnataka. with all the above actions i think bjp can win karnataka.               my prediction bjp can form a government with jds but cannot get majority. some of the things happening amit shah and his team have been able to do magics in uttar pradesh. here we have to see what magics he can do so that his party becomes superior over others.             author has answers and answer views   this seems highly improbable considering the political situation in karnataka but this can happen if bjp forms a coalition government with jds in the coming assembly elections in the state. karnataka is the first of the four states which will go to elections in . bjp and congress will be in a tussle to win majority seats in  constituencies in karnataka and will be looking to secure above  seats to win by a majorityand form a government in the state. bjp has been motivated by the recent election results in gujarat and himachal pradesh and want their victory run to continue in karnataka too. karnataka currently has inc as the ruling party which won  seats out of  and forming a majority government in the state when the assembly elections were held last time in . there are some strong reasons to back the claim that bjp wont be faring well in the karnataka assembly elections while the survey results and political scenario in the state hints at a coalition government with the votes being shared between congress and bjp with jds playing the spoilsport. the only way bjp can form the government in karnataka is if they convince jds to form a coalition government with them. amit shah may play an important role here. however  in a recent interview of a spokesperson from jds  chances of forming a coalition government with bjp was ruled out as they had bitter experiences with bjp in the past. thanks i have written a similar answer for the question on karnataka assembly elections  please take a look at it once.              author has answers and answer views   originally answered  in my views they might not get the clear majority. when yaddyurappa came to power in  it was kind of a sentimental vote from the people of karnataka. bjp had the clear majority and they made a mess of the next  years with almost everyone wants to be the chief minister with yaddyurappa himself facing de notification case and going to jail. now coming to the  elections it will not just bjp and congress that will be fighting for power there is one more strong contender and that is jds. incase of a hung assembly jds is more likely to support the congress as they did during bbmp elections even though bjp was the single largest party. these things apart but these two gentlemen named amit shah and narendra modi can do magic. its definite that bjp will contest the elections in the name of modi. so if the people get into modi wave then bjp might get the throne.             author has answers and answer views   politics is unpredictable. it is said that even a week is too long in indian politics. presently nothing can be predicted .one survey gave bjp a lead and the other gave congress a lead.undoubtedly there is strong anti incumbency against the present govt. but only one thing works in karnataka and that is caste. even after lingayatveerashiva controversy i dont think it has affected lingayat vote share of the bjp as the ligayats vote for their caste leader. secondly even after so many corruption allegations against yeddiyurappa his party got a solid . vote share in   which is very good for a new party. also bjp lost not only because of corruption allegations but also because of yeddiyurappa and sriramulu who formed new parties and divided the votes . also . vote share of yeddiyurappa and . vote share of sreeramulu is big considering the fact that even a minute  vote share difference can cause havoc to a party. basically bjp lost because of wrong caste arithmetic. it also did not have the right people to lead the party. next after rejoining bjp  yeddiyurappa won from the seat of karnataka in the by a margin of  votes.that was a very big victory margin . where as raga won by only  votes which was less then his previous win in the nehru gandhi family bastion . it must be remembered that bjp is very strong in north and coastal karnataka and bangalore. elections and survey are a proof to this fact. in  bjp won a clear majority in bbmp by winning  seats. also it was the was the first time in  years in the state that a ruling party was defeated in the civic polls. source  we must also remember the jan sangh got a majority in udupi municipality in  and was mostly the second win for the jan sangh in a municipality election in all of india and it was also the first ever victory of the in an urban municipality in . in  general elections  karnataka gave the highest number of seats and votes to bjp  when bjp was in power in karnataka. and bjp won  seats from karnataka in  even though the congress had won assembly elections just an year ago.strong modi factor but the only weak point of bjp is that it is weak in old mysore region. but with arrival of smk things might change. mostly bjp will definitely make good inroads into this crucial region. also another week point is infighting between party members and weakening of party workers morale .but with narendra modi as the star campainer  things can change and will definitely boost party morale. surveys at this moment cannot be believed. even during the  general elections the expected seats kept on varying and in the end the bjp got such a big win that mostly the bjp itself had not expected it.but considering the historical trends and present disappointment with the congress the bjp might win .at worst it will be a hung assembly. ultimately let us hope for the best. jai karnataka vande mataram. source  wikipedia edit a recent survey was done by a kannada news channel . a majority  agreed that there will be a modi wave in karnataka. a majority feel that modis schemes are better than siddaramaiahs schemes.      ', 'hello i am gujarati and working in a startup in vadodara. in all over india everyone will talk about gujarat election result but we are not that much exited about election.because this war is one sided war. as per my view there is no scope of any other party to win election in gujarat. here is the reasons  modi wave in all over india  people of india seen the gujarat development model of modi and as a gujarati we feel and we enjoying that model so gujarati will vote for modi and vote for development.  no competition  you may heard that  mla of congress resign and join bjp for the next election so in congress top leaders there is some conflict and that guide to there own loose. and in gujarat there is no regional strong party like in west bangal bihar and tamilnadu.  gujarat is a state of businessman  as our economy is growing and every businessman appreciate goverment work and businessman vote for the development and that again goes to modi. and many more reason for bjp win.      related questions          yesbjp will definitely win the election because there are some important points why gujarat is unique than other indian states common problems in every state which are overcome by gujarat due to bjp why congress will not win  . divide and rule politics as per cast. .creating hatred among people. . scams just one example i want to give which will clear why bjp is better my hometown is near gujarat maharashtra border near surat..a small towntaluka in maharashtra called as navapurend of maharashtra . from navapur nh surat nagpur passes so from surat to uchhalend of gujaratneighour village of navapurgujarat govt has built a  lane highway before  yrs and then there was congress govt in maharashtra so no any development from navapur to nagpur part of maharashtra till  due to dirty politics of congress and when in  govt changed in maharashtra then bjp approved all the pending projects and gave deadline also for every project and that surat nagpur projectpart of maharashtra  started immediately and now  road construction is already done..thats why bjp is way better than congress i am not bjp supporter but i always support if something good is happening for betterment of country             author has answers and answer views   neta nahi junta chor hai translation not a leader but public are robbers i am fortunate enough to stay in different states of india as well as different regionrural as well urban. what i found is that we as junta public are very ungrateful for what we have received. benefits from the government for rural gujarat similar benefits are provided by government to poor section of society in urban areas. rich junta please dont crib for paying nominal tax amount. you are getting far more benefits than poor section. naming few job opportunity security and best facilities at nominal rate as compared to foreign countries. i agree that there are robbers in politics but if we are put into their position then we wont be any different than them. i have seen a pseudohonest officer claiming for fake hotel and travel bill. so why dont we stop this fight and focus on building a great india from this very moment dont ask me how. figure that yourself. edited english translation of title added.               to my knowledge i predict that narendra modi and amit shah magic will again make the congress boat to sink in the political sea of gujrat. jotting down some factors  predicting a  plus bjp win in gujrat  elections.              chances of bjp winning gujarat are decent enough despite years of anti incumbency lemme explain why. this time the situation in gujarat is little bit tricky congress and its gang of overexcited school kids read  hardikalpeshjignesh is giving hard time to bjp especially in rural belt  years of anriincumbency is finally catching up with bjp so this time its not going to be a cakewalk for bjp. having said that i expect bjp to retain gujarat though with a reduced margin because they are a well oiled machinery its not a joke to defeat a cadre based party in its own bastion for that you need to have all the stars aligned in your favor. there has to have massive antiincumbency against the ruling cadre based party and a mass wave in support of opposition party led from the front by a mass leader. classic case is of  west bengal election when mamata banerjee finally uprooted communist rule from bengal after  years. antiincumbency existed against communists in  and  election too but at that time neither mamata was a mass leader nor tmc was considered a credible alternative to communists but the situation finally changed and all the stars aligned in  election by then mamata had become a mass leader in wake of farmers agitation singurnandigram and people were fed up of communists to the extent that they were saying anyone but communists. similar situation does not exist in gujarat as of now there is decent antiincumbency against bjp but not to the extent of anyone but bjp plus there is no mass wave in favor of congress hell they dont even have a mass leader in gujarat whom they can project as cm candidate and they hope to unseat bjp in gujarat  lol. so the confuseddejected people will again bat for bjp just like bengalis did for communists in  and . this is not congresss mamata banerjee moment in gujarat. for that they have to work really hard in haryana we say sadke naapni padti hai which roughly translates to you have to work on streets and they need to groom a local leader with whom people can identify themselves. in nutshell congress will give bjp a run for its money this time but in the end bjp will retain the state. in worst case they will scrape through with  seats and in best case they might repeat their previous performances of  seats.             author has answers and answer views   it looks like a daunting task now but they could still be in the game for around  seats. bjp and congress are fighting for seats in  constituencies which were predominantly dominated by bjp from  with a brief spell of rashtriya janta party in between and narendra modi bjp  being the longest running chief minister of the state for a span of  years in a row. it was deemed that narendra modi has cast a spell one the politics of gujrat and seemed invincible before being the chosen prime minister candidate. he worked hard for the state and raked in the development model of gujrat and showed the same vision to the people of india and was given a chance to lead the nation. the battle is set again in his home state but the result isnt clearly obvious this time. bjp is losing its charm in gujrat with people not being content with his latest bold measures of demonitisation and gst. moreover  the latest agitations by obc  lead by alpesh thakor   patidar  lead by hardik patel   dalit   lead by jignesh mevani  communities creating an uproar of a change in the politics of gujrat this time around. the patidars account for over  of the states population. most of them have traditionally been with the bjp. the obcs account for at least  and the thakors who form  of the population have drifted to the bjp from the congress. while dalits are traditional congress voters some have switched allegiance to the bjp. but they make up just  of the population. with the obc and the patel communities turning their back on bjp and joining the congress  there could be lots of twists and turns regarding the number of seats which bjp gets in gujrat this time. there are several factors which could hurt bjp this time  the average growth in gujarats agrigdp between  and  when narendra modi was the chief minister was  per cent. in this period allindia growth was about . per cent. but growth has since declined in gujarat. in  its agrigdp shrank by  per cent and there was not much improvement in  either. source   as of january   only onefourth of the farmers in the state were insured under the pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana. of the . lakh farmers with crop insurance . lakh were farmers with a bank loan. the deficient monsoon in  and  intensified problems. in  there were good rains but a bumper harvest in groundnut and other crops made prices plunge. the bonus over and above the centreannounced msp in cotton is a good move but not many are likely to benefit.farmers in banaskantha patan surendranagar morbi and jamnagar districts which were the worst hit by the floods in july are also not going to benefit as they have suffered crop losses. . failing businesses  demonitisation coupled with gst proved horrendous for small and medium traders  artisans  craftsmen. there is a huge discontent among small businessmen  traders with the gst and demonitisation as their market was predominantly dominated by cash. demonitisation with gst in tandem robbed them off many major clients from mumbai and rajasthan who inturn prefer to buy the stocks from their local manufacturer markets to avoid gst. there are many traders who have opted out of switching to gst and decided to work on cash and are repenting and complaining about the policemen who harass the stocks transporters for a gst id. small businessmen and traders are wary of keeping a full time ca for gst returns every  months which could cost them additional rs per month for such an intricate tax return system and would cause additional financial burden and feel that they are betrayed by the bjp government for such poor implementation. demonetisation also had a considerable impact on the revenues of the companies. right after demonetisation traders lost  of their revenue in the quarter octoberdecember  and this trend continued on to the next quarter when it reduced by . during the quarter ended december last year small and medium enterprises reported  dip in revenues large companies reported a  dip while exporters stated that their revenues dipped by  in the aftermath of demonetisation. lets look at the chart below for impact on revenue of manufacturing companies while revenues mildly recovered during the quarter between apriljune  they again started to dip during the most recent quarter between julyseptember  on account of the rollout of the goods and services tax. the gst which subsumes all indirect taxes that businesses pay on their inputs was launched on june . since its launch it has faced a lot of glitches and businesses have been disrupted. in the quarter ended september  revenues dipped for small and medium enterprises by as much as  according to the latest reports and  for large companies and exporters. revenues however continued to increase by  for traders in the same quarter. bjp needs to be wary of these facts and find a way out to avoid these issues to become the reasons for their downfall. . growing unemployment  a new report published by all india manufacturers organisation showed that the impact of the abrupt withdrawal of  of currency one year back has had a massive impact on manufacturing companies across the country resulting in massive job loss and less job creation. the report surveyed  respondents across the country ranging from businesses such as trading corporations exporters and manufacturers of varied sizes. these included large companies as well as micro small and medium enterprises. it found that  of jobs in trading organisations were lost in the quarter octoberdecember  that is in the first  days of the old rs  and rs  currency notes ceasing to be legal tender. during the same period medium and small enterprises were also hit hard with  of jobs going away while large companies saw  of their workforce shrink the survey found. if we take a look at the scale of job creation in manufacturing companies in gujrat  some recovery seems to have happened since then in the quarter between apriljune this year when micro small and medium enterprises reported  increase in jobs while traders reported  of jobs coming back. this was coupled with exporters and large companies reporting about  of their jobs returning. considering this is modis homeground  he ought to change this scenario or it wouldnt be long when bjp gets dethroned from their long held state. . mounting attacks on dalits  in a pattern seen in several villages across the state dalits are being attacked by members of the uppercaste community for going against generationsold norms. source   gujrat was hit by a series of scathing attacks on the dalits by people of upper caste community causing a huge furore and acting as a fuel to the burning fire of discontent for the law and order  demonitisation  gst implications. these issues are taken up by the opposition parties and no stone is left unturned to target bjp for their responsibilities towards minorities of the state. despite all these issues  bjp is presumedly said to be winning as per the latest poll survey in gujrat and the fight has intensified. a recent prepoll survey showed bjp was still ahead in the race for gujrat and would go on and bag  of the votes in gujrat. this however  is a big decrement from the solid position bjp was in few months back in august when the prepolls showed that bjp are gonna sweep aside  of the votes. according to the survey the ruling party will win  seats the opposition party will get  seats and others may end up with  seats in the seat assembly of thestate. the survey predicts that the bjp is likely to get  vote share while the opposition party is likely to get around  of the vote share. however notwithstanding the prediction of a victory for the bjp the second round of the prepoll survey shows huge gains made by the opposition party in the last two months as the bjps vote share falls. in less than three months the opposition party has gained major ground in two politically important regions saurashtra and kutch having  assembly seats and north gujarat with  assembly seats. these issues and the discontent among the people of gujrat has started taking a toll on bjp as of now. there is a huge mind shift in gujrat which is bent on to bring about a change in the politics of their state and are in a mood to give congress a chance. with the minorities shifting towards the congress and a wave of poor results post bold moves by the prime minister could likely pose a threat to their longest kept state. keeping up with the latest happenings  it is deemed that narendra modi will take charge of the gujrat campaign. as congress vicepresident rahul gandhis navsarjan yatra in north of gujrat ended on monday the ruling bharatiya janata party bjp in gujarat is set to launch its massive campaign led by prime minister narendra modi. mr. modi is likely to address one big rally in each of the  districts in the runup to the assembly polls in the state. prepoll results are often a deviation away from reality  but we can still get a feel about the state of mind of people in gujrat right now. the battle has immensely intensified  lets see who gets out on top. thanks             author has answers and answer views    i am a mallu living in solapur maharashtra.  years ago while i got selected for national level science exhibition to held at ahmedabad gujarat and being organised by kendriya vidyalaya and iit ghandhinagar. we were a set of  students representing mumbai region. and we were to travel through bus from k v iit powai iit bombay to k v ahmedabad cantt. it was pm and we couldnt sleep or feel comfortable because of the rush city corridors and road conditions in mumbai and thereon. it was somewhere around am when the roads seemed flat and straight well cleaned and beautiful trees surrounding. the gujarati driver announced proudly we are in gujarat. we slept peacefully than before our teacher woke us all as we where about to reach our destination. we were astonished to see clean and neat ahmedabad city with disciplined vehicles and cops effectively handling the traffic. greenery that was artificially generated and serene path ways across. industries at far ends which could never be felt but only be seen from here. at first sight anyone could understand that its a well built city. its  years now and obviously there would have been a lot of changes in betterment either which are very evident. a state which was hit by dangerous earthquakes and by communal riots brought to this stage is a completely miraculous journey and bjp is part and parcel of this conversion i guess the people of gujarat arent mad enough to vote bjp out from this developmental sequence they are in. i strongly believe there isnt a minute doubt to who is gonna win gujarat bjp note i am not a bjp bhakth but i cant deny what i saw what i experienced and what i got. yes am a modi fan image source google images                 chances of rahul gandhi winning the election is if rahul gandhi joins bjp i went to vote on th was around  a.m when i reached the polling booth. i was standing in a long queue waiting for my turn to vote. i got to notice two housewives standing beside me. they seemed to belong from lower middle class family. as they were little louder in their conversation i heard some pieces of their conversation. lady  you know whom to voteright lady  of course we need to vote for modi. lady  be cautious. we cannot take a chance to mistake lady  yes i know i remember that i have to vote for number . only bjp incident  another day i was just changing channels in television. i gave rest to buttons of the remote when i saw one channel which saw area around where i live. reporter was roaming around the area where i live. she was choosing random people and asking whom they would like to vote. i would just describe one conversation which would summarize all the ones. here is talk between one ordinary lady and reporter reporter didnt gstdemonetishation impact you lady jo modi ji ki tarah mahenat karna jaanta he aur sahi kam karta he  use kuch nai fark padtawho knows how to do hard work and always work with honesty like shri narendra modi is never affected reporter what do you think about the patidar agitation lady was little louder this time. lady hello madam me patidar hu par muje reservation nahi chahiye. reservation wo mangte he jinhe mahenat nai karni hoti. ham khush hei am patidar but i donot want reservation. the people who ask for reservation are lazy. we are happy when ladies around her heard this they gathered around her and together they saidmodimodi aur sirf modi whole event was live so it was hard to believe it was promotional event by bjp. alsoi knew some of the ladies. sparkle in the eyes of housewives eyes while saying modi has cleared my all doubts. in both the incidents it seemed to be only  incidents but it precisely tells lakhs and crores of gujaratis says who witnessed gujarat model again i would repeat chances of rahul gandhi winning the election is if rahul gandhi joins bjp also let me clear one important fact i dont mind if someone likes and upvotes my answer      ', 'bjp can be undone in  besides handing out a formal victory to the bharatiya janata party bjp for the sixth consecutive term emulating the left front record in west bengal the assembly elections in gujrat have sent out some other calls as well. two of these interrelated ones are the announcement of rahul gandhi arrival as a serious challenger and the vulnerability of bjp in free and fair elections of . gandhi has finally shed his reluctance to take on the task of reviving his party and has thrown himself full time into it with all his energy. far more significant is the fact that during his extensive gujarat campaign he refused to react to the agenda set by the bjp spearheaded by prime minister narendra modi which had nearly become the norm since around . he was constantly setting his own agenda and forcing modi to respond to it. modi did so by jumping from one wild allegations to another inconsistently in a characteristic attempt to divert attentions from the sharp attacks on the disaster brought about by his reformist measures. gandhi had obviously given considerable thought to setting his own agenda focus on the economy on behalf of those who had suffered most over the past three years and a half and to sidestep the question of his religious identity as irrelevant to the electoral battle by visiting temples if a bit clumsily. his constant refrain was the favours given by the modi government to five or six corporate houses and the wilfulneglect of poor farmers the small businesses and tribals and the daily wage earners i.e.masses. even as he mocked modi and the government his language was never below par unlike on the other side. this too may have earned him some approval rating. by aligning the congress with three angry though raw young men venting up social platform against the present dispensation gandhi also showed the maturity of a seasoned politician in forging alliances for electoral victories taken as an exclusive modiamit shah preserve. all in all he stood up with his feet firmly on the ground. and he landed up with respectables result for it. he has demonstrated that he is his own man. victory and defeat are after all relative terms. the modishah triumphant march to claim  seats out of  on the other hand was given a short shrift by confining their party to  just above the half way mark. of course  would be dismissed by shah as a chunavi jumla much like the promise of  lakhs i.e. not to be taken seriously. the dividing line between a serious electoral promise of the bjp and a nonserious chunavi jumla is getting harder to detect. problem of credibility at any rate the gujarat elections did show that alternative agendas have replaced a single agenda. where do congress and gandhi go from here not being a committed congress supporter i could fairly announce none of my concern but as citizens it does concern us all whether we are being led in one direction or another by our political class. we would thus expect that gandhi besides sharpening his focus on the economy would also take up another perhaps even graver challenge to the integrity of the indian nation posed by the sangh parivar the assault of hindutva on bharatiyata. the bjp did raise its hackles during the elections over gandhis religious identity and he sought to respond to it by overly demonstrating his hindu evenjaneu wearing self the conventional soft hindutva response to hard hindutva. a very defensive soft hindutva at best much like attempting to win over the hardcore mullahs by quoting the quran and the hadees to them. even at a personal level at least three strands of religious identity mark gandhis being the kashmiri pandit the parsi and the catholic and to foreground one of the three is not the most honest or even endearing act. but far more important is the identity of indianness bharatiyata which is by its nature inclusive and antithetical to a single exclusive religious identity. when asked by the sangh parivar to prove his religious identity in gujarat if he had responded with my religion is bharatiyata the questioner would have probably run for cover. but unfortunately that chance was missed. with as much energy as gandhi put into his gujarat campaign highlighting the economic distress unleashed by the modi government he needs to now pick up on the other equally major disaster being wreaked upon india by the same forces. the economy can perhaps recover in a short or medium span but the damage to indias cultural and social fabric would be far more durable and deadening. this needs to be taken up as an urgent campaign around the country a campaign that is inclusive of all whose hearts beat for the nation. and one cannot wait until the dates of the next elections are announced to start this campaign. it is not hard to imagine that the electoral process and this campaign are intimately intertwined. the bjps hindutva card is its chosen pathway to electoral victory the bharatiyata campaign should be a counterpoint a breaking of the link between religious identity and the political process. a bharatiyata that is not partisan to any segment not weighted for or against any group of citizens. a campaign to proclaim proud to be indian. civil society has already initiated some baby steps in this direction by launching campaigns like not in my nmae and say no to hatred which evoked massive response across the country even as the initiatives were taken through spontaneous rather than organised action. the ground support for an organised and sustained campaign is ready. will gandhi the congress and others take up this bigger challenge this among other actions will be an important step towards rejuvenating the yearold party.      related questions          no. bjp winning in  is statistically improbable. indian voters are very mysterious. the formula upon which they decide to vote is more mysterious than duckworthluis formula. lots of variable factors play their role in elections its impossible to discuss all factors  some are already discussed. i will try to give my view through statistical point of view. at the same time i will try to be neutral and unbiased. lets crunch some numbers first.  bjp vote share .  seats won   ratio between percent vote  seats  .  congress vote share .  seats won   ratio between percent vote  seats  .  congress vote share .  seats won  ratio between percent vote  seats  . source wikipedia  in the recent history ratio between percentage vote  seats won was lowest in . it means where bjp won its winning margin was small and where bjp lost its margin of defeat was huge. in other words with a smaller negative vote swing bjp could lose its existing seats. and in order to win at other seats where bjp is now nd or rd bjp needs a bigger positive vote swing. in simple words from this point bjp can lose easily but to gain more seats they need big efforts. point no  in  bjps success was attributable to states like up  bihar  rajasthan  mp  gujrat  maharashtra  zarkhand  karnataka  chattisgad  haryana  nct  uttarakhand  himachal  . that is  seats almost  seats. that is pretty impressive and optimum as well. its the top of a curve any further improvement is not possible but you can expect some correction. its improbable to repeat the success story of up gujrat mp rajasthan etc. so how much correction  or  or  lets have a fair estimate  correction that is loss of around  seats in bastion. bjp need to cover those seats from rest of india. in maharashtra  bihar bjp has seat sharing agreement with its ally. lets come to point no  west bengal odisha andhra telangana tamilnadu kerala these six states have  seats out of which bjp holds mere  seats. bjp does not have great foothold in these states but lets asume in  bjp will sure gain some seats. but how much even the most loyal bjp supporter will accept bjp cannot gain more than  seats in these states. that left us with remaining around  seats which include punjabassam kashmir northeast states and uts. of these  bjp has  seats. but kashmir  northeast was never the bjps forte bjp will surely lose punjab and assam is unpredictable. still asume bjp will maintain its seats in these states though highly unlikely. still bjp is falling short of majority mark of . in the answer i have not considered factors like opposition will be united  well prepared this time with grand alliance voters reaction to the current bjp government sure there is some negativity due to no action on black money  corruption gst implementation etc. minority votes will be united this time unlike  common this is a major factor in voting in india but strictly on the basis of statistics i think bjp will not win in . please understand i am not commenting who should win or not. or who is capable leader. i am just expressing my view about  election. or may be bjp will form government with help of alliance. but my main answer is strictly according the question.               originally answered  i bet on it that bjp is definitely going to win the  election. why and how  and if he is the candidate against modi then modi is definitely winning this elections.. . arvind kejriwal may also be the candidate for  elections from the aam aadmi party. and if he is the candidate from the aap then too bjp is on the higher side. no chances.  . last but not the least the most important and appealing thing to me is this. the times group had conducted an online poll. the poll results are mindblowing . though these  elections are not a cakewalk for bjp then too bjp has a greater mass on its side and too many advantages than that of the other parties and candidates.  upvote..             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  bjp has a very high probability of winning the elections in . in  they had an unprecedented success in northern india so much so that states like gujrat and rajasthan gave them all seats up gave them  seats and they had a fabulous success in maharashtra mp and bihar as well apart from success in smaller states like haryana uttarakhand and delhi as well. they had hardly any luck in odisha wb tn and kerala as such in terms of number of seats but the unprecedented success in northern belt ensured that they had majority on their won. now lets say in  they can only loose seats from what they had in  in the northern belt i.e. their tally will be a bit less than what they had in  if not a dramatic fall from  tally. among bigger states gujrat and mp they will be able to retain like  i see no issues as such except they may loose  seats there. in bihar they had  seats but then that time bjp fought along with ljp and other smaller parties now they have alliance with jdu which will ensure that they retain  seats in bihar and if luck has it then they can better their tally of  i.e. about  seats. maharashtra can be a cause of worry for them in  they fought along with ss where as this time ss may take an independent stand and they may end up loosing seats. bjp may not want to have an open alliance with ncp ncp option if only post poll and that too tactical for them so in maharashtra they may end up loosing some seats if ncp and congress goes to poll together. up is in same situation bjp can only loose some seats in up due to antiincumbency as well as due to the fact that yogis performance as cm will also come into picture in . now how will they compensate the losses in the northern states and maharashtra thats where tn odisha and wb and kerala comes in picture. with a not so strong aiadmk nda can expect to do well in general election in tn and if they enter in an alliance with aiadmk they can only hope to increase their tally by  seats there. bjp is working hard in kerala and wb to take up the opposition slot and in all likelihood  they will do better in those states in comparison to their  numbers. in odisha bjp is slowly replacing congress as the main opposition and will hope for a better number in  it was almost a swipe out for bjd when they won almost all but one seat there. bjp can hope to win more seats this time if they project dharmendra pradhan as the cm candidate there as assembly election will be held along with general elections in odisha. based on this analysis i hope bjp will still come to power in . the only real hope for opposition to make any dent to this is if they win up handsomely which is only possible if sp bsp and congress fights together and ends up winning  seats. this is where mayawati and her party bsp will play a crucial role. bjp will do everything to ensure that mayawati doesnt align with opposition in  polls. this will be the single most largest threat to bjp in . apart from up even if mamata wins handsomely in wb she cant form the government alone without left parties and congress. so even if bjp falls short of majority for some reason they will have a better chance of forming the government. so in all likelihood the  election slogan will be aakhri baar modi sarkar as modi will be  in  and wont contest the elections. ps i am not a modi fan but this is my practical view. edit the slogan i suggested comes from the  nda slogan i.e. aakhri bari atal bihari even abki baar modi sarkar is a copy of ndas  slogan i.e. abki bari atal bihari.             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  from all that we can see now and predict there will definitely be an nda government taking the oath of office after the  general election. what remains to be seen is if bjp will win over  seats a simple majority on its own  and mr. narendra modi wins a second successive mandate. given that up mh wb br which account for  seats combined will most likely see a bjp v rest everyone combined into one scenario it will be extremely difficult for bjp to win close to  of the popular vote. states like mp cg rj gj may also cede some seats to the opposition as they hold a near centum seat share in those seats. in such trying circumstances it is definitely possible that bjp gets seats in the range of . in that scenario the opposition and other constituents of nda will call this as a mandate against narendra modi and would want a political lightweight or a lutyens delhi candidate for the pmship. remember the paranoia of parties like ss rjd and congress is not the fear of bjp. it is the fear of narendra modi and amit shah. they will do anything to unseat him and install a friendlier person in the pms chair.             author has answers and answer views   let me make things simpler for you. let us assume there are  eligible voters who will be voting in  general elections. government trust levels are generally determined by whether or not people consider their government stable and reliable if its able to protect its citizens from risk and whether it can effectively deliver public services.  going by the census  data the nda states population tally . million is now nearly seven times that of the states ruled by the congress and its allies . million. considering the mean of  and  more than  people are going to vote for bjp. removing another  people considering political uncertainty and inconsistency atleast  people are going to vote for bjp. in  bjp got . votes and got . seat share in the house interestingly congress with . votes got just . seat share in the house. in order to become the official opposition party in india a party must gain  of the seats  seats in the loksabha however the congress was unable to attain this number. considering political mathematics absence of official opposition and modis increased popularity even with  people  vote share will result in  seat share  seats out of  for bjp nda. so even a mahagatbandhan with lack of official opposition is unlikely to turn things around time speaks further read                let us consider certain issues and developments to justify above points and our mentality we have results of bihar election as proof where lalu got maximum seats. thats how illogical we can be.               originally answered  actually we cant say anything may be or may not be. but for the betterment of the country he should be become prime minister for at least two or three terms. the reason when i am saying may be are but when i am saying may not be then i am really afraid of few things and started thinking about following points actually predicting common indians thinking is very difficult and peoples memory are very volatile. when media started showing some thing and they listen certain things they started to believe on them and they are going to forget all the good things what happened in past. basically its human nature when we hear a lie multiple times we started to believing on that as its true. and history is witness of these things many times when people made huge mistakes in influence of moments and later realized that it was biggest mistake. i am sharing a real incident. it was th nov  i was traveling from mumbai to varanasi via train in sleeper coach along with my friend. it was bihar state election result announcement date. train was fully packed as next week was diwali week. in our compartment very hot discussion was going on why bjp lost bihar election. i was silent observer and just wanted to listen what other peoples are thinking about modi and nda. surprisingly nearly  of people at that time thinking that modi is not doing his job and nothing has been changed since he became pm. people are saying like  modi ko videsh ghumane se fursat mile tab to kuch kare modi bas bolata h kuch karta to hai nahi  bhai wo to bas bade aadmiyon ki baat sunata h  kala dhan lagta h setting kar ke apne account me daal dia hai. i was shocked to here such type of comments and nearly  of the people are believing in this. i thought they are not aware about reality thats why they are talking like this dont worry they will know and they will think positive. but next moment i thought who are these people omg they are the common people who are just talking without any fact and figure but they are voters they will give votes and they can influence others in there place. our  india lives in villages and a part of them doesnt care about any fact and figures. they just follows what the other people thinking and saying or what the local leaders are informing them. believe me in  every opposition party most of the media channels are going to spread just negativity about pm modi and new issues like intolerance and secularism and blah blah .. will going to be evolve again and again to stop modi. but i have full faith in our country and country man that they are not going to be influenced by such issues. they will choose what is right and what is beneficial for the countrys future.      ', 'there are good chances that bjp will secure  seats majority required to form the government in this election. the party has learnt a lesson from bihar elections where thevikas rhetoric didnt work in favor of it. what hurt the party more than the grand alliance is its complacency. they didnt want to repeat the same mistake in up by being complacent after the landslide victory in lok sabha elections winning  mp seats with a vote share of .. much of which can be attributed to the modi wave but before i list reasons why i believe bjp would win this election let me introduce the man whos running the show for bjp in up sunil bansal party president amit shah handpicked sunil bansal for the role of general secretary of up who previously assisted him in  lok sabha elections in up. bansal was an activist of the abvp rsss student outfit  in rajasthan who later went on to become its national joint organizing secretary. bansal who is shahs righthand man learnt the importance of data compilation for electoral purposes and slowly picked up the caste intricacies of each district in the state. he learnt from shah the importance of organisational activities that would keep the party cadre busy and perennially connected with the people. strategy what did they do in the run up to this election brijesh pathak with amit shah my prediction would be a bjp government or a hung assembly which might result in an alliance of bjp with bsp. sources             related questions          i dont know what the results are going to be but bjp seems to be on winning side in up because       thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful          originally answered  it is too close to call at this moment. sp is not only at a disadvantage due to antiincumbency  but also due to its votebase being scattered. its votebase  yadavs  muslims is no longer in the mood of indulging them at least the muslims are not. though the govt has of late completing the development projects it has lost the goodwill of the people due to the infighting in the party. the infighting has wrecked the party. akhilesh is quite popular though. too bad for him. the lesser said about the congress the better. bsp has a good chance though its coffers are empty thanks to demonitisation. if the muslims and dalits rally around bsp with brahmins also lending some support then there is no stopping mayawati. with law and order taking a hit urban voters would want to vote for her. bjp no longer enjoys the support it once did in . general elections are very different from state elections. also the effect demonitisation had on voters is not known. though the chandigarh local elections is a shot in the arm for bjp it is to be noted that chandigarh is an urban constituency unlike much of up. my hunch is that bjp will certainly increase its tally if luck favours say to . quite possible. the fight is certainly between bsp and bjp. a spinc alliance would be disastrous for the sp. sheila dikshit will not win. congress is somehow out of sync with the ground reality. a fractured verdict is also possible but lets hope it doesnt come to that. a bspcongress alliance is possible if inc gets around  seats heights of optimism. to sum it up a bjp govt on its own highly unlikely. it will increase its tally through.             author has answers and answer views   my prediction bsp king maker. bjp single largest party. explanation the bjp is likely to choose a backward caste leader to helm its uttar pradesh unit as it starts putting in place its strategy for the crucial assembly elections in  sources said. the party will elect a new state president in the coming days and among the frontrunners are legislator dharam pal singh lodh and general secretary of the state bjp swatandra deo singh. the current state president laxmikant bajpai is an upper caste brahmin. closer to the assembly elections the sources said the party is expected to announce an upper caste leader as its chief ministerial candidate for the state in a departure from its strategy in most recent state elections of not naming a presumptive chief minister. in most state polls since its mega win in the  national election the bjp has not projected a chief ministerial candidate banking on prime minister narendra modi as its face to draw votes. the strategy was seen by many to have backfired in the recent bihar elections. the party believes projecting an upper caste leader for chief minister with a backward caste leader steering the party as state chief will balance the bjps appeal in indias most populous state where caste has traditionally played a crucial role in determining election results. the bjp had won  of uttar pradeshs  parliamentary seats in . the sweep was credited to bjp chief amit shahs strategy and a modi wave. pm modi won from varanasi and chose to represent uttar pradesh giving up the other seat that he won from his home state gujarat. in recent civic elections however the party did not fare well in uttar pradesh. it lagged behind the ruling samajwadi party and mayawatis bahujan samaj party which made a comeback after being wiped out in the national election winning not a single take on the regional giants samajwadi party and bahujan samaj party in the  assembly elections the bjp will look at getting its caste balance right. frontrunner for state chief dharam pal singh belongs to the lodh community which makes up about four per cent of the states population. lodhs have traditionally supported the bjp. former chief minister kalyan singh is seen as the communitys tallest leader but he is now governor of rajasthan and out of state politics. since it became a marginal player in up in the s the congress has performed well just once  in the  elections. that year convinced that it will form the next government in delhi and the bjp is out of the race the minorities and upper castes voted tactically for the congress in several constituencies taking its vote share to around  and number of seats beyond . but that performance was an aberration brought about mainly by the belief that it was destined to win. unless something dramatic happens the general impression is that the congress is destined to be wiped out and thus it is unlikely to retain even its  vote share in the next election. so with the congress out of the equation the outcome of the election will depend on just one factor how many of the antibjp voters abandon netaji and line up behind behenji. whether the congress contests alone or becomes part of an alliance is unlikely to make a lot of difference to the final result.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful          it is ram rajya vs ram leela in up lets look at the sequence of events hence the qualitative scorecard is as follows bjp early mover but slipping on a banana peel mulayam has quit politics to keep sp afloat till  mayawati my enemys enemy is my friend. pulling sp down the sinkhole congress cautiously roping in priyanka since they have understood that rahul  defeat sadly development doesnt win you much in this part of the country. as long as you cake hindu foreheads with vermillion and thump skull caps on the muslim cranium you can win irrespective of whether half the state shits in the woods. my .              author has answers and answer views   let us discuss party wise and at the end we will conclude.. conclusion  hence bjp is almost choice for party to vote. modi wave coupled to recent demonetisation success to expose corruption surgical strike development plank law and order issue will favour votes in bjps favour. my predictions  for govt. formation  seats req. result  bjp will return to power in up in         thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful        author has answers and answer views   originally answered  bjp does have a greater chance of winning the election. all other parties individually may at the most scuttle the chances of bjp and reduce it to largest party thereby see that no party get majority. out of the remaining if any two party join together then they may win majority. then bjp may find it very difficult to get majority on its own. at present this seems remote since all the other major parties have announced their cm candidates. there are different schools of thought for bjp to win the election. by not announcing the cm candidate the party stands to gain. all the casts and communities which support the party will cast their votes to the party hoping that their caste leader will be the leader of the legislature. non projection of leader is to their advantage. polarization of voters have already taken place. hence any further polarization through gharh wapsy or cow vigilantes will only boomerang on the party. but mention of ram mandir may help the party since vast majority are still great devotees of ram and looking forward to the construction of ram temple. another school of thought feels by announcing a cm candidate he will rejuvenate the party and take entire party machinery behind him as is being done in assam recently and karnataka in . but unfortunately or fortunately bjp do not have such a leader at present except rajnathsing. but he is not willing to go to state politics. hence at present it is not feasible. coming to different caste groups supporting the party forward castes comprising  brahmins thakurs vaishya bumihars  kayastas etc are now solidly behind bjp. after dayashankars episode it was thought the party may lose. what followed later when nazeemuddin used fowl language against dayashankars  year old daughter and his wife balanced off. further mayavati did not at all take any action against her leftanant. this has infuriated the forward castes. further bjp took prompt action immediately. hence if bsp thinks that it can cash some brahmin votes it is mistaken. the entire lot will go behind bjp also a portion of other backward castes will also vote bjp because our pm belong to backward caste and also state bjp chiefe is obc. it may not expect any support from sc and minorities such as muslims and christians. among the youths irrespective of castes it may get some substantial support . on the whole bjp may get around  votes which is sufficient to get majority. whereas bsp which was thought will give a tough fight to bjp has gone way behind now. it may come a close third behind sp.             author has answers and answer views   originally answered  i am repeating what i had given in answer to a similiar sounding question. i am not a traditional bjp voter but the wonderful performance of the nda govt led by yug purush atal ji  had won my heart. there are a number of good things his govt did but the national highways plan tops the list. then there was kargil conflict. however i particularly feel obliged to him for his decision to form three new states including my home state uttaranchal. what was great that he insisted on inclusion of haridwar in uttaranchal. naturally i felt sad when bjp lost in . i voted for bjp in  lok sabha elections because like all the sensible voters i too wanted to see the back of the shamelessly corrupt and brazenly arrogant congress. in  the basic aim was to remove congress and voters were looking for the best available alternative and somehow they found that bjp led nda was the best option. like most voters i too did not expect much from bjp and modi ji since in my view they came to power merely because congress was not good and deserved to be dumped. presently i am impressed by the work being done by bjp led nda govt and in my view narendra modi is not just the best out of all the leaders he is actually far far better and no other leader comes anywhere near him in leadership qualities integrity and dedication. regarding uttar pradesh it is well known that bjp had won  ls seats of  seats and  more seats were won by its ally apna dal. of the  opposition seats  were won by gandhi family of congress and  went to sps yadav family. bsp and other parties got nothing. in view of the good show in  bjp leaders are expecting miracles in  as well but that may be easier said than done. bjp is also keen to win so that it may later improve its tally in rajya sabha. the pressure is more in view of the unexpectedly big loss in bihar. now the weaknesses of bjp are many ranging from lack of a cm face to mindless import of defectors from other parties. similiar charade is going on in uttarakhad too which will also have elections in  almost simultaneously with uttar pradesh. actually locals fear that the mass scale defections from congress may even lead to defeat of bjp in  uttarakhand assembly elections. while it would be difficult to predict victory or defeat for any particular party at this juncture but it is certain that bjp is not going to have it easy since sp still expects a come back in view of its claims of development and clean administration. it is seen that the akhilesh govt did not attract any serious allegations of corruption. on the other hand bsp is not yet ready to be written off. mayawati sees bjp merely as a runner for the third place. while mayawati is seen as a good administrator but some call her a dictator. there is yet another viewpoint that sincere voters would not forget massive scandals like nrhm and might keep away from bsp. congress is also there but the common perception is that it has not much hope. there is yet another threat from coming together of splinter parties under the leadership of ajit singh who is being propped up by some anti modi leaders from few other states who have strong grudge against bjp and particularly hate modi. the imminent danger emanates from the highly ambitious currency demonetisation or note bandi plan since poor people in both urban as well as in rural areas and farmers are facing difficulty in view of the non availability of legally usable currency notes. bjp led govt at centre seems to be overdoing its cleaning act and needs to look at farmers issues not just up but whole of india and must provide them relief. however it is a pleasant surprise that bihar chief minister nitish kumar is strongly supporting pm modi for having come out with the currency demonetisation plan. it makes me think of the unthinkable. think of it will nitish babu rejoin bjp led nda. the still best part is that the people are now looking at modi with huge expectations and let us hope that the modi magic will work in uttar pradesh  elections as well. the people who think demonetisation has failed and that it will cause defeat of bjp in elections in  and in  are seriously mistaken. bjp may loose for any other reason like weak candidates and if voting is along the lines of caste and religion but not because of demonetisation. the people who understand the common psyche can easily see that there is going to be a dramatic change in the peoples thinking about voting about development about corruption and clean politics and drastic shift will be seen in voters loyalty to caste based leaders and political parties and the leaders who talk of religion for political gains will face the music and also henceforth voting patterns would now see a huge qualitative change. obviously the prime minister narendra modi is the flavour of the season.       thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful ', 'text', ' senior

did not do anything for the scsts.  congress was quick to leap on to shahs faux pas with rahul gandhi tweetting now that the bjp it cell has announced karnataka polls time for a sneak preview of our

 this is what is politics all about. there are no friends and enemies forever in politics. tdp has nothing to show to its people of the work done in the last  yearsso what should be their game plan for the next election blame the center which is bjp. shiv sena was always vocal about its discontent with bjp primarily because they wanted some the prime portfolios in the government despite not really having a very good numbers in election. secondly bjp had always played a nd role in maharashtra politics while their partner shiv sena played the main role so this role reversal was hard pill to digest for the shiv sena.      related questions      author has answers and answer views   the nda alliance is like an alliance of cows and buffaloes. when the herd is grazing on pasture they accomodate each other and believe on peaceful coexistence. while they are engrossed in their own world they fail to notice the storm building up. when the storm rages in they give different defensive reactions. if the storm is coming from the west the cow will start running to the east so that it moves with the storm  alone bearing the pains of speed. the buffalo will not run to east like cow but to the west towards the direction of storm. this act of them inflicts on them lesser pains. similarly the alliance partners are having intuition of building of political storm. they are aligning themselves leaving the cow plus bjp to activate their defence mechanism while keeping their own alignment in safer angle. the pains will be lesser. mr naidu of tdp and mr paswan of ljp  has weather radar fixed in their brain. they are old horses. they have survived many storms in past because they followed buffaloes instinct.       promoted  by scry were building a community of people who can

understanding if greed in to loot. unfortunately thst opportunity did not pan out with the bjp. we have witnessed vast areas where some fundamental changes have had a dramatic restrictions in opportunities to accumulate ill gotten wealth. this may be in defence contracts to supervision of huge grants given to states. the state level politicians who are largely regional satraps are largely riddled with rampant corruption. they have an easy option to blame theur shortcomings on the centre. they think that people are latgely unaware thst most of the state issues are state responsibility. the  election is looming infront and these gangs would like to strike fresh deals to loot. they achieve local emotional support wh is translated into votes that will allow them to hoodwink the same people is a win win for them. if they manage to get a lucence to loot people will vote for them and if they can not strike a deal then they will go breast beating from the roof tops and people will bless them with votes it is therefore expected thst these regional bands will make noises. it would be nice if people can see that the regional leaders are largely driven by personal greed. it would be interesting to get a view on how these regional satraps have amassed huge fortunes and the source if their lavish lifestyles. do not forget their friends and families while making an assessment. bjp perhaps is not spotless but huge strides have been made in distribution of welfare with far greater transparency than ever witnessed. licences to exploit the national resources are also more transparent and the defence contracts with far greater emphasis on indigenous production is worth noting. elitist gangs of greedy indians are finding all this uncomfortable. it is left to bjp to create greater awareness with evidence in this areas.             its because they are afraid of becoming extinct in the political scenario. this is one of the most basic rule of politics to never ever allow to grow even your partner on the cost of yours. they are now watching that support of bjp and specially narendra modi is increasing even in those areas where once bjp was zero so they are just trying to counter bjp and secure their vote bank             this is just blackmailing. naidu has underrated mr. modi. let us workout the arithmetic. mr. modi has numbers more than half what is required and the no confidence motion initiated by tdp will only boomerang and actually the bjp was anticipating naidu  s move. there is no tension in bjp camp. the loser is tdp.           author has answers and answer views   may be the reason  the bjp alliance parties have shown their discomfort because they have realised their machinations will not work out with a tough pm like modi and they would like to try new alliances with other parties with fond hope that if they come to power with the new alliance they can achieve all their ulterior motives. gouraswamy krishna murthy        ', '

almost  years. bjp havent ruled much as compared to congress. at the beginning congress was also not much corrupted but how days passed the things started to come out. this time the people of india elected bjp with full majority .we have to wait and watch till the end and after that also. how much money spent for advertisement during electionsany idea  from where that huge amount of money comes from  very few people are there they used to donate the money for political party as a party fund in crores . as compared to other party bjp is managing things in a very clever way. and maintained transparency in some of the government departments.also providing good governance as campared to previous governments. overall i can say that bjp is less corrupted as compared to all other political parties. thank you.      related questions      author has answers and answer views   originally answered  i have many corruption related questions against modi government only  of the indian population had been curious to know the truth about i am not making a case for voting the congress back to power. both the bjp and the congress are equally corrupt. in addition the bjp is communal and does not believe in freedom of speech or religion or even your right to eat the food you want to. in all the bjpruled states except goa the sale and consumption of beef is banned. if only indian people could be as curious as they are about how sridevi died india would have been a very different place..           author has answers and answer views   i have no reason to say that corruption is growing in the bjp regime. however i also have no reason to say that corruption is reducing in the bjp regime. the fact is that it was mostly business as usual in old and new regime. the difference of perception is generally due to the fact that there is a considerable time gap between committing an act of corruption and its coming to light. lets understand the four phases of corruption. phase  the pretense of honesty when a political party or a public servant acquires power he pretends to be absolutely honest who has been send by god to remove all corruption from his department or the country. in reality it takes some time for any new party to develop secret linkage with the corrupt officers and corrupt businessmen to engage in corruption. in the first phase of his power he pretends to be extremely honest since he has not yet committed any crime and he has no skeleton in his cupboard. however by being honest you cant raise illegal funds for your party or self. soon a few right people  find ways to approach you and you gradually start helping them first for the party and then for yourself. this is the beginning of the second phase. phase ii breaking the codes once your code is broken the news spreads often by these right people that they can get the work done in the new regime. soon more and more people start taking their help in getting their work done. everyone in the business knows the right contacts and wants to use it before others. your reputation of corruption starts spreading quite fast but still remained only within a limited number of people. phase iii spread of discontentment when you help someone your action naturally cause harm to someone. if government favours one party the other party loses naturally no government can help everyone and satisfy everyone. hence the losers in the game want to get even with their rivals and the people in power. they now start gathering evidence so that they can demolish the reputation of the government and kill their rival. they can hope only the new government to help them because the existing government is now trapped with their partnerincrime. phase iv spread of the stink once the rivals get sufficient evidences they tip off the opposition parties and media houses and give them the evidences. soon the mask of the ruling class peels off and the hidden skeletons start tumbling. everyone is now aware of the real state of affairs. public start cursing the government and feel cheated and get disillusioned. opposition parties are rejuvenated because the latest corruption of the present government makes the public forget about the old corruption. they are in business again. this cycle continues till the existing regime is voted out by the people. then the new game starts with new players.              originally answered  lets make it more rational.if we divide  marks in  aspects of a government that is i would give modi ji . out of  for all this  year government. so it was all my assessmentevery has there own point of view this was mine.. thank you           author has answers and answer views   i cant say that without any clear evidence at least unless reported in newspapers. corruption has become a standard feature in our society and it is only steadily picking up over time. i put the blame at the door step of our polity. as more  more politically influencedmotivated scams come to our notice we tend to get disillusioned. and we also tend to rationalize ourselves cutting corners. when the example is set by political bosses why bureaucracy should fight shy they have their own protection they buy it. sometime ago a subregistrar told me do you think i will keep all the bribe money you are paying a good part of it will go up to the revenue minister. bjp is part of the system. it would be very innocent to assume that it can be different. you either do what everyone else does  survive or you simply fall by the wayside. there was one particular political party launched in hyderabad some years ago. it simply could not survive because it had neither the money nor wide public support.              the above data conducted by transparency international says that india is not able to end corruption in the last decade. it means that we cant say that the corruption has being completely rooted out from india its true that we have improved a little bit during this govt tenure but meantime the trend is likely to be reversed when loksabha polls are nearing. still we ranks  in corruption among the  countries which is a concern for indian economy.            originally answered  saying that bjp government was corrupt while modi was in gujarat is definitely wrong. if bjp government were corrupt then there were no chances of gujarat becoming one of the most developed state in the country. now the question arises that why narendra modi was not in favor of appointing a lokayukta in gujarat. actually this action couldve effected the image of modi in a negative way just like a dunce who needs to be supervised and is doubted for doing something wrong. since  election was about to come maintaining the image and legacy of modi was a must for the victory of bjp.           author has answers and answer views   originally answered  most government entities are corrupt to an extent. they have a lot of power and easy ability to abuse that power. money can always sway people if i offered you an extremely high amount of money to do something more than likely you are going to do it even if you dont agree with it. everybody has a price tag. that being said not every government entity is so corrupt that they dont care about its people. the choice in which entity you choose is the choice between which one you believe is more corrupt or which will hold your interests better.        ', '           originally answered  it is a big morale booster for sp and bsp who are struggling to accumulate decent numbers in the parliament and state assembly in order to stay relevant in politics. sp and bsp alliance may have shaken the confidence of ruling party but it is a timely reminder to bjp as not to underestimate their opposition. this will help them to stay alert in the upcoming elections. the result of the bypolls in phulpur and gorakhpur are being discussed much in the media because of the symbolic significance of the constituency. but if history is any lesson for common man it can be concluded that in a democracy no leader is invincible no constituency is lifetime bastion of a particular party. in different context and phase of time voter choice is subjected to change based on his unfulfilled demands. bjp who has successfully constructed voter base gathered from array of communities belonging to different caste and class lines failed to pay attention to nishad community an extremely backward caste in the region. sp and bsp alliance mobilized the community against bjp and won the elections. sp and bsp who are arch rivals in the state of up for last two decades have successfully managed to test their alliance in these two constituency. but imagine these two parties fighting together against bjp in the upcoming lok sabha elections at national level. in my view both these parties have to trade lot of compromises to sustain their alliance. bypolls could be won with limited financial and human resources but to arrange resource at the scale of national level sp and bsp have to work together from today only. they will commit mistake to project the result of this bypoll election with their fate in the upcoming general elections. they shall care to accept the fact that bjp is a star campaigner supported by best minds in india working  at the back end to enhance their chances of not winning election but winning with heavy margin. the bypoll result in my humble opinion is an alarm bell for bjp and a moment of celebration for sp and bsp. sources the indian express and other news website. viewpersonal.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful related questions      author has answers and answer views   there are  answers to the question  with people raising question mark on selection of candidate for gorakhpur and insinuating unhappiness of yogi in selection of candidate and  antiincumbency pm and president of bjp not canvasing and low voter turn out particularly in urban areas etc etc but i have a slightly different take on the election and would like to share my views with the readers. gorakhpur has been the safest seat for bjp and bjp has been winning the same since  and the last mp yogi adityanath has been elected for  consecutive terms and was promoted to be cm of the state just  months ago. insinuating that the candidate selected to replace him was not to his liking s raising a question mark on loyalty of yogi adityanath towards his party bjp and parent rss and is totally against the ethics and propriety as propagated by both these organisation. antiincumbency against cm  bjp antiincumbency does not come into play on seats like gorakpur and insinuating there was antiincumbency against bjp government and cm in the state is odd as the government is not even  year old and conventional wisdom says it takes  years for antiincumbency to set in. gorakhpur is not a seat where pm or bjp president need to canvass  and if pm and bjp president need to canvas extensively in constituency like gorakhpur then what is definition of safe seat and it raises another question if gorakhpur need extensive campaigning by them then what about other  constituency . low voter turnout has always been implied as positive by bjp as its cadre and support base is taken as solid and it is said that they always come out and vote and it is generally the cadre and support for the other political parties which is described as fickle who do not come out to vote. but bjp lost the election to gorakhpur seat and what does it implies a. if bjp can lose a seat like gorakhpur than anything is possible. every political party should note this as in future there are chances the same can happen to similar seats across board. b. success tasted by bjp in up in  and last assembly election was a result of opposition vote getting divided and this bursts the bubble of popularity and acceptance. c. the social engineering affected by spbsp coalition has potency to displace the bjp apple cart in future. d. if there is credible opposition candidate who has chance to win  voters will vote in their favor. e. the good governance and so called changes being affected by bjp government is again a bubble which got punctured. f. the brushing aside of issues and painting everything as hunky dory  taking criticism personally  using unparliamentary innuendos  trying to name  shame opponents  trying to create a polity as we and them etc has shelf life and such efforts are reaching their expiring dates. g. in near history it has happened for the first time that ruling party has lost by elections to the seats vacated by both its cm and deputy cm within a year of coming to power. h. the sheen of invincibility on bjp has started coming off and a dent to tina there is no alternative has been made and the election since gurdaspur by poll are pointing towards the same. i. economic distress unhappy middle class unnecessary social stress communal overtones  propensity to preach and order dearth of meaningful dialogue and discussions in public discourse putting self on high pedestal and looking down on everything and everybody  silence on contentious issues instigating citizens against each other etc can be few reasons why urban voters largely remained indifferent to polls. how these elections should be read it is my opinion that its still early days to read too much into the results except it opens new possibilities and there are opportunities for opposition to explore and exploit and chances are that the talk of preponing general election with state elections to rajasthanmp will be more subdued. the economic distress because of failure of demonetization and erratic implementation of gst and constant overlooking of middle class interest along with farm distress are a reality and is affecting people  the propaganda for positive changegood governancenew india is a bubble and waiting to burst. we live in democracy and in parliamentary democracy alternates are found and elected and the popularity of a leader and tina are reasons generally articulated by dictatorships and in parliamentary democracy a party should win largest seats to form a government and there are chances that alternates to many sitting members are found in  and nda ..              im living in gorakhpur since birth so i can surely answer this. firstly only  voting happened in by elections than usual  at time of general elections. the city is main base of bjp gorakhpur and voting here was meagre  that too in muslim ghettos the middle class lacked enthusiasm to vote and took it for granted. so this low voting had already written the script of defeat still it was a close contest. secondly nishads are the highest in terms of caste nos. in gorakhpur and the coalition of sp bsp and nishad concentrated all the casteist votes in their favour. thirdly this time yogi was busy mostly in tripura  it has  nath population for campaign and adequate time wasnt given here. but development works are going all around the city. there is no antiincumbency or peoples mood against bjp although some may be unhappy but not to that context otherwise it wouldnt have performed so well in local elections about a month ago. it has just been a case people didnt come out to vote. remember even  general elections were won by bjp when voting percentage was about  . edit as i said bjp got  votes in the city which is the main bastion of yogi but overall voting percentage in city was too low eventually the main reason for bjps loss. casteist stronghold too helped the coalition of spbsp.and whatever the news media likes of ravish kumar who was doing naukri series when bjp won  north east states but gave full primetime analysis to byelection and others say i can tell you people dont give a damn about it. the bastion is still intact. and people who say that hospital tragedy created effect i can tell you for last  years ive been reading dainik jagran and it is many times seen on th page that so and so no. of children died due to encephalitis in medical college. people have become habitual of such news. just read the stats in case you want to know. edit as i have talked to few more people then i came to know that some people of paswan community were not happy for the stringent actions being taken against bjp mp kamlesh paswan and that led to some shift of votes although he was from same party. also people are unhappy about the rising prices of construction materials as yogiji had put an end on illegal mining. also this year there was strictness in board exams and as a result . million students left the exam. so a quite portion of electorate didnt take well the idea of good governance too. hope they get to know better next year.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   reasons to lose gorakhpur  allahabad candidate  antiincumbency the bjp candidate was not of yogi adityanaths choice and thus his followers from gorakhpur hindus  muslims both did not vote in these bypolls. this resulted in the lower voter turnout since people were ready to take a chance after  years to vote for a nonbjp candidate in such situation. on the other hand spbsp were in a do or die situation and thus they put extra efforts. their supporters were keen to go out and vote for this alliance. thus most of the  people who voted were from the antibjp group. absence of amit shah and modi modi and amit shah were not very much keen to involve themselves personally into these bypoll elections. this resulted in the division of votes to various parties and bjp supporters to not vote. in fact if you look at the bypolls all over the country bjp does not seems serious about them. target of bjp is to win assembly  general elections. what i think is that through bypolls bjp reads the strategy of the opposition parties and then use it in the main elections to prepare itself. poor and lower income group this section of society lacks basic needs and they hardly receives the benefits given by the government. they are unaware of various schemes launched by the government and do not have sources  mediums to communicate with the government. this results in division of votes. when modi and amit shah does all the rallies they attract a lot of crowd and votes are shifted to bjp. spbsp alliance it was evident that sp will join hands with bsp after a failed trial with congress. sp  bsp both are more of regional parties with lesser presence out side the state. they had to get together for their survival and they did. this partnership shifted the votes of yadavs obcs muslims  dalits to one side. attitute of people in a state where around  lakh students do not appear for board exams just because cheating was not allowed what do you expect from them to vote for development or vote for cast and religion people of up are still very much interested in cast and religion based politics. they are happy with a leader of their own cast at the cost of development and growth. point to be noted while this might have bring some happiness for sp  bsp they should not take it for granted assuming that people are getting sick of bjp or modi. people of india are currently under experiment mode. they do not mind to have some local or other parties than bjp at root level but they would still prefer bjp for the central government. this is evident from the fact that congress did really bad in these bypolls as well. well nothing else was expected from it either. when it comes to loksabha elections at national level indians would still prefer bjp to any opposition party because the base of sp  bsp is not very strong in other states and they are sick of congress totally. a united opposition will also not help them to win because an alliance with congress means suicide for any political party and then there is no other leader in opposition than rahul gandhi who would have a recognized face all over india. bjp on the other hand should see the bell ringing. it should not take people of india granted. the present government is trying very hard towards the nations growth but most of the indians are middle and below middle class. they are more concerned about the current issues and problems rather than to care for the future of india or of their children. bjp should not go very strict towards it policies and must keep in mind that a healthy india in future is possible only when people are ready to change. the current government should not just bring new policies but also try to change the typical indian mindset and merely advertising to give up lpg subsidy is not enough. government have to take it to a new level and should try to involve as many people as possible in its schemes and activities so that we know first hand that what are the changes required why are they important and how it should be done.             author has answers and answer views   bjp vote share in gorakhpur in  assembly election was  and sp bsp combined vote share exceeded . so if sbbsp combine by itself will win if vote share stayed at same level. this time congress lost deposit. it means most of congress votes could also have transferred to the combine. when spbsp combined they seale the fate of bjp. even in general elections congress is fond of calling bjp  vote share govt. so if all antimodi factions get together come together bjp will lose power on paper. that it has taken opposition  years to realize shows lack of strategy on their part. they will likely fall apart on the question of leadership as congress will claim as their birth right. however some parties has poor taste of association with congress. i believe presently only sharad pawar can act as glue as he is a good strategist. unfortunately he heads very small party. another person is chandrababu naidu till recently bjp ally and will be kin to take revenge for alleged humiliation he suffered.but his political birth is on account of strong anticongress feelings in andhra. possibly leadership will be shared.       thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   i am bjp supporter and i will accept verdict of people. i am not going to say that we had a moral victory or something that sort of. i believe that the bjp lost due to following reasons  i think this losses would help bjp to be more serious and formulate a strategy to counter spbsp. this bypolls also proved that no one in india has the power to face bjp alone. but i would suggest that rahul gandhi should not be happy at all as his party lost deposits in both seats and it can dash his hopes to be pm as the regional parties are growing but his party has lost across india. rss vhp and bjp voters should also not be over confident over bjps victory all the times and they should go out and vote. image

is the combination of multiple factors such as         ', '         author has answers and answer views   originally answered  any type of vandalism is not good for india. but we must note that the lenin statue was built on private land by private people. these people themselves demolished the statue. lenin has lost relevance in todays world. he is not a saint or a great leader. he was responsible for killing of millions of innocent people in his home country of russia. lenin stalin mao killed almost same number of people killed by hitler. communism theory talks about killing of innocent people to make a new society. it is ok for communism to kill  of population to abolish the privileged class and bring equality in the society. the end of indian communism may be very near. they destroyed the beautiful  progressive state of west bengal. the writing is on the wall for communists. these were the same people who supported china during  indiachina war. once prakash karat told during debate on nuclear deal it is their duty to stop indiaus alliance against a fellow communist country china. these people have not been loyal to cause of india. they have ruled tripura with iron hand and only communists supporter got benefit of their rule. one example india has moved to th pay commission whereas tripura is giving salary based on th pay commission. lenins statue has fallen everywhere after the fall of communism like in ukraine russia poland etc. it is quite natural that same thing would happen in tripura. these same communists had vandalized statues of leaders like indira gandhi in tripura during their rule and it is payback time.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful related questions      author has answers and answer views   only in india you can exercise your democratic rights to install statue of a dictator and cry fascism when it is removed  before beginning let us see who is the person in discussion. lenin is not a figure which was revered anywhere outside communist circles. even communist find mass killings in lenins regime difficult to explain. stalin was a direct successor and a result of lenins ideology. he unleashed a terror bigger then lenin. lenin showed the path of brutal oppression to stalin by his own example. so lenin was the root cause of terror which unleashed by stalin. victims of lenins ideology would be even higher than the direct killings done by him. no wonder many statues of lenin have been frequently removed or even destroyed even in russia after fall of soviet union in . in other places of world the statues are kept but annually pained in funny ways comic book superheroes one year bright pink next year and so on just to make a statement against him. but such statues are revered in india today we cannot find lenins statue except a limited places of erstwhile soviet era. and india of course but why he should find support in india few people know that the founder of the indian communist party in  m. n. roy actually met lenin . the ideology of working for people seemed very appealing to him at that time. but soon lenin showed his dark side and his brutal ways started to come in public attention. but roy chose to ignore even justify and to some extent even emulate that. despite everything done by lenin roy remained a member of the lenins organisation for communists for eight years. now i must admit that i find lenins ideology actually marxs ideologycommunism in general somewhat appealing. but problem is that only in an utopian world we can see the ideology working on ground. it has done more harm to poor than any capitalistic ideology could ever do hint readers are advised to read animal farm  which explains it beautifully by an allegory so problem really was not so much in the ideology itselfbut the ways taken to fulfill the ideology to a large extent the political killings by left wingers in india follow the precedent set by lenin .  the party here should learn from party workers in west bengal the methods of eliminating political rivals leaving no evidence. this alleged statement finds weight after we have benefit of hindsight to witness cases of killings and missing opponents of the communist party. now coming to the statue the statue of lenin was installed to celebrate  years of communist rule in tripura after winning the  assembly elections. there are reports that local cpim workers would regularly come and hold meetings in front of statue which would disrupt local people. but make no mistake the act of dismantling the statue was totally unfortunate and should be highly condemned. the people who carried it out should be severely reprimanded. the clowns who carried it out dont understand that they are not doing service to anyone by such kneejerk acts. what drove those people to take such action we dont know. either they certainly they didnt dismantle the statue to protest lenins ideology. i suspect if they even knew about life and works of lenin. if the accused who have since been arrested were really bjp workers sooner bjp get rid of such people the better. we can make a wise our enemy but never make a fool our friend. but equally amazing is the response of many left supporters and amusingly aap workers who never admit of following leftist ideology in open even on quora they are comparing this to this their logic could be accepted only if they also spoke a word during this so they are selectively deaf about the things and all their logic is applied to suit their motives. i would have accepted their concerns in essence left supporters fail to look into mirror while they call others out classic case of pot calling the kettle black. but media attention is very misplaced and they should have rather focused on the right issues. sooner we stop talking about dead statues and start worrying about living people the better. footnotes                    i wont go into a political debate of right or wrong here because i am the least qualified person to do that. but as someone from tripura i will definitely give my pov. the demolition of lenins statue after bjps victory is a representative action. no it has nothing to do with lenins ideology here. it represents arrogance. it represents intolerance. it represents the vandalism that is being carried out throughout the state. the destruction of public and private property atrocities on people who have political inclinations different from bjp or rss. i dont care about lenins statue. i cant care less about lenins statue actually when i am calling home thrice a day to check up on my parents to tell my parents not to go out unless it is absolutely necessary to tell my sister to stay in and keep my parents in. i am getting calls and messages from friends in other states asking me about the conditions in tripura asking if my parents are okay. i am calling up my friends and relatives to check if they are okay if their locality has been safe. and none of them had anything to do with active politics ever this is a conversation i had with a friend around  am on sunday. and i have many other such conversations in the past two days. me what are you doing up so late at night him trying to maintain peace me how him by helping the people of cpim guarding them. me what are you saying are conditions that bad him there are people at my home too and these are friends who are as much away from politics as possible. they are good people who have been just and fair and peaceful but are now somehow caught in a shitstorm because they cannot see people getting beaten up because of their political inclination. if you check the local news of the state you will see that in every part of the state this vandalism is going on. and i am worried that the people i care about might somehow get caught in the middle when things turn ugly. am i paranoid might be. but these are people i love this is a place a state i call home. and it hurts to see things turning this way. cpim didnt work hard for the development of the state corruption was rampant unemployment high i understand i understand that people voted for bjp because they wanted change they wanted development. and they believed bjp can bring that change. and i thought it was justified too. but is this the change they deserve i was born in tripura i have grown up there. i was proud how peaceful the state have been all these years. we have had elections before too. ideologically congress and cpim didnt exactly see eye to eye either. but that didnt call for demolition of statues mass atrocities vandalism. because power before was not arrogant. they respected people their property their choices. but with bjp that changes. it was seen in other states now it is happening in tripura too. people who actually understand polarizing ideologies talk debate write protest peacefully they dont go around vandalizing beating up people. so no. dont tell me it is about ideologies. as someone from tripura how i feel about it i am fucking angry. i am disappointed. it is scary to see otherwise peaceful people being radicalized so easily and turned against each other. but i would lie if i said i am surprised. with bjps track record in other states and the divisive campaign they ran in the state i would be pretty stupid to expect otherwise. and yeah with friend and family in the state i feel pretty helpless too.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   for long and till yesterday tripura remained the bastion for left ideology a shift in democratic polity after the election changed the things overnight coming to question democracy is indispensable to socialism. vladimir lenin its ironic this same democracy gave the power to freshly elected helmsman and eventually got his statue removed in tripura vladimir lenin may seems irrelevant in current political situation of tripura but the essence of his contribution still remains the centre piece for any democratic government in the world.his differences over capitalism was born from his inclination towards proletariats or the working class. after the wwii and economic crises governments all over the world barring few exceptions transformed into  as they govts found its a good course to have a blend of both capitalists and communist influences in policy making. thereby safe guarding the interest of both working class as well as capitalists by encouraging private industries as they are the key drivers of economy and generators of employment. its unfortunate that todays act was done under the disguise of democracy to bury the legacy of  years left government which provided a fine leader with integrity like history could have been respected as said by tripura governor tathagata roy everything is fair in love and war and later this also shows the democratic ethos of india transition of power from one democratically elected government to another its not a rare incident of this kind occurred but statues of lenin were . hope it will not raise an unrest and peace prevails           author has answers and answer views   looks like i am the second person from tripura to write an answer on this thread. i will start with a little background. i was born and raised in agartala and now live abroad for higher studies. though i didnt vote in the elections this year i am in constant touch with my friends and family back home. firstly ill start by mentioning that i am extremely overwhelmed by amount the coverage my state is getting. probably most of us are not used to such exemplary coverage in mainstream indian and few international   and social media. so much so that bjpfightslenin and tripura were top trending tags in india in last  hours of writing this answer. prior to this whenever i told people indians that i come from tripura what i mostly got was a bewildered and inquisitive look. usually i gave them a quick geography lesson about the northeast india. funnily enough now those people are giving me political science and history lessons pertaining to communist revolution in russia. secondly coming to the point about how do i feel about demolishing of lenins statue  this is aghast i believe the statue was erected with approval from the local governing body and it is outright vandalism to bring it down without approval from the authorities. without going into what is ideologically right and wrong time and again we have seen that mob violence did more harm than good. to update you another lenin statue has been brought down . also to give you an idea a good part of tripura and parts of west bengal are studded with statues and roads commemorating famous communist leaders. a road called lenin sarani runs across the heart of capital city agartala. if people want to change it fine but do it in a proper way thirdly i am also disappointed to see the hue and cry over the demolishing of a statue where the ambiance of the state isnt very positive. there can not be absolute denial of the fact that people who had allegiance to cpim are being attacked harassed and mishandled by a section of people. although the postelection violence isnt something unheard of but the scale this time puzzles me. a section of the society are overjoyed and others are terrified. there is absolutely no middle ground. this is something alarming to me. following is a screenshot of a conversation in our school whatsapp group friend  my uncle isnt going to his office. people have been throwing stones at their home. this is the change they are bringing. if i turn to congress tomorrow they will even start to beat me. its just a few goons are doing that. friend  post election violence isnt something new. earlier it was cpm cadre this time its bjp. friend  so how is bjp better than the earlier guys at least they cpm did not go this low. friend  even one of my uncles place have been targeted for stone pelting. friend  o fk ask him not to go there. i consider myself and my family to be rather politically unaligned to any political party and have been neither vocal supporter nor critic of any side. even then when i talk to my father now he clearly sounds concerned about what is happening. to the newly elected government of tripura congratulations i look forward to work together for the next five years towards our common goal. in the meantime i would request you take a note of the unrest in the state and take action against the concerned people. peace footnotes         thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   i was supremely happy when i saw pictures of the demolition of the statue of this archtraitor and archtyrant. who was vladimir lenin  he was supposedly a great revolutionary who established a dictatorship after the dissemination of his wholly utopian ideas which were never practical to begin with and received active help from the kaisers government in germany during wwi when the russian armies where battling the german armies on the eastern front. he was shipped in a sealed boxcar to petrograd russia in a train which travelled across german territory from zurich in switzerland and started a revolution in russia which toppled the czar and took russia out of the war. in short he and his revolutionaries stabbed the russian army in the back and toppled the monarchy while at the same time signing the treaty of brestlitovsk which gave away large parts of western russia to germany austria hungary and turkey see the map below to see the large areas of russian territory which lenin and his bolsheviks just signed away to the central powers before pulling russia out of world war i. the bolsheviks and the german delegation signed an additional agreement on  august . here the bolsheviks agreed to pay six billion gold in compensation to german interests for german losses on the eastern front. after toppling the czar and murdering the czars entire family in a basement in the city of yekaterinburg east of the ural mountains lenin setup a marxist dictatorship which used absolute and unrelenting terror as its mode of governance  systematically murdering all opponents and establishing sweeping surveillance. in the end bad karma always begets a horrible death. vladimir lenin the russian revolutionary and architect of the soviet union died from syphilis caught from a parisian prostitute and not from a stroke as has always been believed new research has claimed. stalin lenins successor continued this murderous legacy after a power struggle which murdered scores of rivals and which killed  million soviet citizens from the years  to . stalins monstrous record was surpassed by mao who also happens to be a hero to our totally inane communists in india. mao murdered  million people if you include the casualties of the korean war. the treacherous indian communists seem to forget that maos forces attacked india in  and started a political partnership with our rival in the subcontinent  pakistan which has been continued by his successors to this day. mao had a little competition from  polpot who murdered a third of cambodias population castro the korean kims were not far behind in perpetuating this murderous record. the eastern european communist countries and cuba have all experienced dictatorships foisted by this harrowing and murderous ideology. what has communism given mankind  i can only think of three things. atrocious lies mass murders and total surveillance. when i saw the happy and triumphant people of tripura tear down the statue of this tyrant a flood of relief and indescribable happiness filled my heart. more power to the people of tripura  these very scenes were repeated in several counties in eastern europe in . to those puerile idiots who compare the pulling down of lenins statue with the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas by the taliban i can only ascribe the communist habit of drawing atrociously false comparisons for this. where is buddha who taught peaceful meditation and forbearance..and whose statues in bamiyan were declared a unesco world heritage site and where is lenin the massmurdering sociopath whose corpse is neither buried nor cremated and whose statues were torn down all across eastern europe after the fall of communism if a statue of jiten paul had stood in the place of that sordid mass murderer lenin then i am sure that the people of tripura would not have pulled it down. who is jiten paul  one may ask. jiten paul took part in indias independence movement in brahmanbaria district of bangladesh where he was born. he brought out tripuras first bengali daily jagaran in  jiten paul was a veteran journalist and freedom fighter who passed away some years ago at a hospital in agartala at age of . with his demise a brilliant legacy of journalism and social movement in northeast india came to an end. to those communists who are protesting the pulling down of lenins statue in agartala as a fascistic assault on indian democracy  i have only these words. get a life you imbeciles  your time is up  you know it but live in total denial but you forget that one billion indians know that your time is up             author has answers and answer views   you can hate me for this. but i loved it lenin is neither an indian nor a saint. he is no less than hitler. there is nothing about him worth respecting. this quote may give you some idea about this monster. one man with gun can control hundred without one. vladimir lenin still not satisfied ok. now have a look at this image.  they are ukrainians demolishing lenins statue in kiev. they are the people who have suffered a lot due to him. they know who is real vladimir lenin beyond the soviet propaganda. they know him much better than spineless communists of india. they are not fools. thousands of ukrainians lost their lives due to him. everytime the ukrainians saw this statue they were reminded of the oppression suffered by their ancestors. it was a symbol of oppression laughing at them everyday  the only way to get rid of him was demolishing his statue. during the s more than  lenin monuments were demolished in galicia and volyn at the turn of the s more than  lenin monuments were removed in western and central areas in  more than  were demolished mainly in central areas and in   monuments were demolished. demolishing of lenins statue is a popular phenomenon across post communist states. it is so common that actually there is a term for it in ukraine called leninopad a pun literally translated as leninfall.  it took people of tripura  years to realise this. but finally they toppled down communism along with its symbols of oppression. i support the people of tripura in their fight against this oppressive and antiindian ideology. malaria is treated by quinine  communism is treated by leninopad. you can learn to perform leninopad from this youtube tutorial video. perform leninopad  save lives source  footnotes       thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   what are the views of tripura people on the statue of lenin being demolished after the bjps victory disclaimer  i am not from tripura but i think so are the others who have answered this question before me answer requested. thanks and . i am very least concerned with lenin or even the communist party of india or tripura where the bjp had recently won a well deserved handsome victory in the elections but will focus entirely on the act of a jubilant mob pulling down a sundry statue in a public space. and when altaf called it vandalism i can not but agree. there can not be a better word to describe such acts of demolition or destruction of public property for political reasons. it is pure and simple vandalism and by a motivated mob. but then what one can logically expect from a political outfit which practically paved its own path to power in most of the states and the center with the stones from another monument similarly vandalized and destroyed  with just this one vandalism a winning formula was born. fundamentalism and fanaticism of whatever religion hinduislam christian or jew or ideology  be it leftist or rightist  can find manifestation of and fulfillment only in destruction and vandalism.  the question here is not of whether it is buddha or lenin whose statue was destroyed and by whom islamist talibans or an inebriated with power right wing mob but it is this act of vandalism as a celebration of victory is the surest sign of decadence and danger. and more importantly this appears to signal a new trend or trail in the political ethos of the country. otherwise how are we going to reconcile this happening in the northeastern corner of the country immediately finding a ready resonance thousands of kilometers away in the southern most state of tamilnadu  so comrades or mitron politics and governments can either be about actual construction or token destruction either about vikas or vandalism but unfortunately the choice right now does not seem to be in our hands. images are from internet.           ', '         author has answers and answer views   normally the ruling party tends to win byelections as people do not vote for an opposition party and making themselves ineffective in the process. unless they have an anger against the ruling party which they want to demonstrate. here it is even more strange that the seats were vacated by the cm and deputy cm and gorakhpur was held by yogi for over  years. so it is a shocking defeat. yogi has cited overconfidence as the main reason. perhaps. that the electoral arithmetic will work was probably not reckoned. if we get into a little statistics of voting bjp has got  more votes than what it polled in the state assembly elections though a lot lesser than the percentage of votes in the  lok sabha election. but it is the combined vote share of bsp and sp that saw them through. only to prove a point that the mahagathbandhan of the sort experimented successfully in bihar is applied to up it can be a different story for bjp in . proves the ugly point that indian electorate have not risen above caste politics totally. so bjp needs allies for sure and needs a wave to sail them through . the only positive is tina factor.       related questions        originally answered  a high iou index of opposition unity. when ever a party in power acquires a modicum of invincibility all opposition parties pool up their resorces  forgetting their seperate agendas and fight unitedly the ruling party. the degree of their combined might is determined by quality of their unity . in up it was obvious that unless sp and bsp hang together  most assuredly they shall be hanged seperately by bjp. having tasted significant success will the combo continue in future is anybodys guess  as they are not natural allies. bjps biggest loss is not a couple of parliament seats but the invincibilty halo that was around modishah combo. good show by congress in modis home turf gujarat bjps recent losses in rajasthan and now in yogis back yard gorakhpur are clear indicators that  show is very unlikely to be as spectacular as  performance for bjp . with regional allies of bjp flexing their muscles  we are likely to witness intersting times in the run up to  mahabharath. one can safely assume that  finale will be as riveting as any of bollywoods block busters jaw dropping climax.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   many of my relatives live in uttar pradesh. i am familiar with the ground reality there. this is exam season and most of the students and their parents in up are furious. yogis strict administration has ensured that organized cheating is absent this time. now many students may fail. this is how power supply works in up  but all that extra power means increased bills crackdown on the power thieves installation of meters. so obviously many people arent happy with that. bjp kept its promise of loan waivers to farmers. but the farmers are not satisfied for some reason specially the potato and sugarcane farmers who are not getting right prices for their yields. the road construction in the rural areas and even a few urban areas is happening at double the pace in comparison to sps time but the corruption in these projects is under check. the local contractors are not at all happy with that. before yogi took office up was a safe haven for local thugs and other mafia but now in the last year alone there have been thousands of raids hundreds of encounters and hundreds of voluntary surrenders. when such illegal activities are curtailed people lose their source of income. all the bureaucrats and government servants are in distress. now they have to come on time leave on time register in their biometric attendance. the work pressure is significantly higher now. in sps time the obcs specially the yadavs used to magically grab every top government seat clear every interview get promoted with bullet speed. in bsps time the same used to happen to people from some other caste. now everything is fair and open. its natural that people from those castes never have and never will vote against sp or bsp. caste based politics is here to stay in up. also the unfortunate outbreak of encephalitis and subsequent death of children didnt help the bjp in gorakhpur where the byelections were held. all these people hold a grudge against the current government there maybe they are right maybe they are wrong. a lot of them voted for the bjp last year but didnt come out to vote this time. but since the opposition parties united this time the division of votes which were cast against the bjp didnt happen and that hurt the bjp. but i wont consider this the general mood of the entire state. people are mostly happy with the yogi government. a satisfied voter doesnt come out to vote specially if its a bypoll. that explains the low voter turn out. if there were to be assembly elections in up today bjp would still be the single largest party despite sp and bsp having joined hands.             nobody can understand equations of up politics if he isnt a localite  havent played games of politics in up. the main reason of loss of bjp is low voter turnout its said about up that all the votes polled after  goes to bjp. in up whole voting procedure flows according to caste lines. sp votes yadavs muslims  candidates castemates. bspscst jaatav only muslims  candidates castemates. bjp upper caste scst nonjaatav maurya kurmi jaat  candidates castemates. up is a state where more than  youths  labourers live outside their assembly seats for education job  better living.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   let me tell you the absolute reality. everyone will keep saying that this is because of spbsp alliances or people lost faith in modi ji or yogi ji is not up to his promises to the people of up. complete wrong information. in up we all are with yogi ji he is the best cm we have ever got and we still have full even more faith in narendra modi. so what happens in byelection the only reason for bjp defeat in up byelection gorakhpur turned out to be only  votes and phulpur even worst turned out to be only  voting. in phulpur spbsp candidate won with a margin of around  votes and in gorakhpur spbsp candidate won by a margin of only  votes. you can see less voting  in phulpur  more margin for spbsp so if it would have been even  voting i can bet both bjp candidate were going to win by a margin of at least  lakh votes. the fact in up is muslims sp core vote bank and dalit bsp core vote bank they never forget votes. least interested community in giving votes is general category like brahmin rajputs and thakurs bjp core vote bank. my mother cast her vote first time in  when i told her that she has go she used to say my single vote is not going to make any difference for bjp but dalit and muslims dont think like this voting for them is like a festival kudos to all. so out of this  in gorakhpur and  in phulpur spbsp got most of their votes as their vote bank showed an active interest in bypoll voting but bjp voters did not take it seriously and half of them did not even cast their votes. hence bjp lost. i can bet my head on this in  when the voting  will be  bjp is going to win both seats back by a margin of at least  lakh votes. even if it is spbspcongressanyother  bjp. it is the ground reality             now let me told the truth after all bjp it cell workers have wiped the ass of bjp.i live in uttar pradesh and i am a regular voter of bjp.the reason bjp loose in recent by polls of up and others  jaitlie worst ecnomic policiesno relief to middle and salary classalso the tax price and petrol price in increasing like hell .demonetization failure to curb black money .poor implementation of gst and harassement of traders and businessperso . ram mandirucc no action .modiji over stress on gandhian philosohy and secularismdue to this the pro hindu voters have lost intrest in him .the failure of modiji to curb activities of pakistan and china against india .bjp tieups with anti national party like pdpnfpp .modiji policy paralysis and failure to implement on grassroot level due to ongoing war going between bjp and bureaucracybjp central govt are being ill advised by ias lobby which want only their benefit and have no concern for india future .modiji govt have cutoff large amount of govt posts and in private sector is not generating many jobshence unemployment is rising .despite huge mandate bjp had ditched its traditional vote bank pro hindu and pro nationalist voters  too much love shown to dalits and mass fund in dalit schemes had not gone down well with general and obc category .despite supreme court verdict bjp had not struck of reservation in promotion of govt jobs . bjp try to woes muslimdalit and yadav had alienated its voter base .the current govt at centre is more concern on media managementbrand management and image makeoverthey have no concern for the people .bjp have an anti govt employee attitude they have unnecessary taken fight against the bureaucracy by giving lowest pay rise in indian history in cpc and usinf indira gandhi time j to instill fear in bureaucracy.they must remember that bureaucrats selected are more informed and intelligent than average politiciansthe whole bureaucracy except ias lobby is up arms against bjp  modiji silence over pak and china and over various banking scam its due to anger generated against modi govt thats why they are loosing the pollsthe anger is so much that despite good work of yogiji govt at uttar pradesh the gorakhpur and phoolpur is lost.bjp will be decimated in the upcoming election in mprajasthanchattisgarh and it may be possible that bjp dont able to cross  mp mark in upcoming loksabha election in       thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful        in gorakhpur there was a divide in bjp. yogi jis candidate was kept aside. candidate was not even from gorakhnath math. people of gorakhpur has their emotional sentiments attached with math. would if someone from math was given the ticketfigures would be different. whereas phulpur was never a safe seat. overall conclusion is bjp didnt took these elections seriously.           author has answers and answer views   originally answered  bjp lost  because the timing of byelection is grossly wrong.both yogiji and kp mourya will lose today even if they contest in person.there is no point in blaming spbsp combine.they both should have immediately vacated their mp seatsonce they took the charge in up the swing of assembly tempovoters were in mood to vote bjp.thereforebjp could have retained both seats.now after one year deficiencies and shortfalls of bjp rule have come out.yogiji begged for votes.but voters were already in mood to teach a lesson to both.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful    ', '         author has answers and answer views   simple reason bjp doesnt understand the peoples sentiments. as a party who is looking to establish their foundation in a difficult state to win they need to understand the culture of that state and respect the feelings of that particular state. this is what bjp has failed to do so far. things like imposing hindi in tamilnadu is a disastrous idea for bjp. its not that we are reluctant to speak hindi but its at a point where you are trying to degrade our mother tongue. for bjp to succeed in tamilnadu they need to win the hearts of the people not by going against their sentiments. and the state leaders also need to understand this and report to the top management on how and what measures that are needed to be taken to understand the peoples sentiments here. moreover such questions in quora like should we kick tamilnadu out of india hindi imposition are tamils are hindus will further decrease bjps political gain in tamilnadu. thanks for the edit k.jagan      by quora for business quora has great answers. have a great solution promote it here.

northern indian who wish to impose hindi and the north indian culture on the tamilians. tamilians are not only proud of their language but also proud of their culture. the hooliganism indulged by the bjp cadres wherever the party is in power in the north puts tamilians off. south indians in general and tamilians in particular are sticklers of an orderly conduct. the unruly behaviour indulged by the workers in the name of cow vigilantism moral policing is not liked by these folks. south indians do not hold the same regressive attitude towards women as is the norm in the north. the bulldozing of the statue of lenin in tripura even before the bjp government has been sworn in has upset the people no end and the face book post of a tamilnadu bjp leader that they would do the same with the statue of the periyar though the post was later removed after a storm broke over it has revealed the total lack of tolerance by the party. the tweet of the governor of tripura virtually endorsing the toppling of the statue of lenin has increased the unease. so if the party fails to add tamilnadu to the bjp ruled states the blame shall lie with the party.             solely because of its state leadership. period we cannot even show a single bjp leader in tamil nadu who speaks about development rather than pro hindutva ideas. religion appeasement wont work out in tamil nadu as it happens in other part of the country. if they change their approach and speak about developmental stuffs  they stand a chance.           author has answers and answer views   this refers to gaurav tyagi. who said tamil people are protective of their culture.  a strong no. evr was a kannadiga who declared tamil as a barbaric language. still all the dravidian parties call him as thanthai meaning father. mgr was a malayalee. he was most respected chief minister who ruled for  years. karunanidhis forefathers migrated from andhra pradesh. karunanidhis actual name is dakshinamurthy. he is the celebrated poet in tamil. vaiko vijaykanth have telugu ancesters. they are treated as heroes here. what abouttamil cinema. most of the heroes and heroines are not from tamilnadu. still they are loved and earning crores. in short tamilnadu is like united states which is called as the land of immigrants. here every tom dick and harry can rule the roost. in the same vein anti good principles are steadily loosing steam.tamilnadu will sooner or later opt for non dravidian parties as they are fed up this dravidian parties. we have to see whether kamal or rajini could make some impact. why bjp could also step in.           author has answers and answer views   recently mk stalin said that he wasnt opposed to the concept of dravida nadu. mk stalin is the leader of the dmk. he said it because he feels that his idea atleast has some support. the bjp cant enter and win in tn because its opposed to dravida nadu as a rule. this is the same reason as to why the inc cant win. if tns politicians talk about dravida nadu then i think that no national party can win there. because national parties are opposed to any concept of dravida nadu. the issue isnt bjps supposed hindi imposition because no national party has come to power in tn from the s regardless of its stance on hindi.           author has answers and answer views   its obvious bjp will never win in tn. for almost six decades tamilians have been brainwashed in to believing that they are the original dravidians and tamil brahmins are the aryan invaders from the north pure bull and so anyone or anything from north is made to be seen by the great tamil politicians as a threat to dravidian culture i cant believe just because i am a brahmin i am anti tamil. how absurd with such a prevailing mindset do you think bjp will ever win in tn. no way           author has answers and answer views   i dont agree with the point that bjp cant win in tn. it will take time but bjp is the only party from all the otger non tamil origin parties that can come close and might even form government in tn. why they are not able to it is simply because they dont have strong leaders in tn. they lack faces that tn people can relate to. tn people are very protective of their culture. an outside face is the last thing they look for in a party. this the only point only regional parties have a stronghold in the state of tn. there are three things that unite indians cricket movies and bjp. for them or against them is a different story all together.         ', '           because indian voters are not as naive as media and some intellectuals would like us to believe. overall i will not read much into the bypolls loss for bjp. because loksabha polls will be fought on entirely different level and it will be modi vs the rest. infact i think these losses have come at a right time for bjp to introspect working at ground level. these will affect their vidhansabha elections in rajasthan and mp where people wont be voting for or against modi.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful related questions        who cares about bypolls specially when you are winning legislative assembly elections  general elections. now tell me what do you want as a party person victory in bypolls or victory in legislative assembly elections  general elections. i hope everyone wants to win legislative assembly elections  general elections. in rajasthan in every  years government gets changed by people. its trend over there  in mp its just co incidence or may be bad performance by bjp but one party has to win  other has to loose so what the big deal about it. the big deal is bjp has won in tripuranagaland where in

meghalaya. situations are diffrent in each case. in nearly all of these election people knew who was going to win. rajasthan  bjp was bound to lose here because of heavy antiincumbency against vasundhra raje and these seats were congress stronghold before  election. mp  the  mla seats were also congress stronghold. these seats come under guna parliament constituencies which are jyotiraditya scindias stronghold. in  election guna and chindwara were only ls seats won by congress. even then the margin of victory was  and  which was previouly k and k respectively. i wont be surprised if the margin was bigger. another thing is that in these states there are only two major parties inc  bjp. so antigovernment vote directly goes in favour of opposition party. for election in nagaland tripura and meghalaya do your own analysis.           author has answers and answer views   why is bjp losing in bypolls bjp is a major national political party of india. it has madate of  of  of   voters of india who are above the voting age. the voters of bjp are based in urban cities of hindi belt. the rural people living in villages of hindi belt are not dominant voters . the recent bypolls held in hindi belt of rajasthan and now in madhya pradesh  is an alarming sign for bjp that the hindu voters are not happy with the performance of bjp. it also means that what the bjp ministers and leaders claim on debates is not acknowledged by voters through their votes. the voters outside urban areas want jobs and good prices for their agricultural produce. if these two needs are fulfilled than in their surplus times they would engage in pursuit of gods and hindutva. people wants to know more on material progress and not spiritual. the agenda of the bjp has been everything than this. when you are hungry and thirsty the issues such as hindu nationalism integral humanism two nation theory racism casteism national freedom movement constitution tricolour integration of minorities in native culture temple and so on dont matter. the bypolls in hindi belt are like avalanche slowly gathering into big mountain. the bjps gaining new grounds in border areas of north east india looks that the

is punishment posting or graceful assignment only time will tell.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful      author has answers and answer views   i contemplated on this for a long time yesterday when bjp won in tripura big time. after losing by polls in rajasthan and mp the media had said that modis chances in  were going bleaker day by day. then tripura happened and the same media said modi is invincible. i knew right away the bypoll results are not a test of modis popularity. the following are the reasons i have come up with for the bjp to lose in bypolls thank you for reading do consider sharing and bookmarking for future reference bhat saheb hey there if we havent met before i am anirudh. i write on politics neetug goa and much more. do pay a visit to            author has answers and answer views   why is bjp loosing sic in bypolls antiincumbency. one can observe that in recent days bjp has been losing by elections in states where the party is in power. bjp could win even in gujarat the backyard of prime minister modi ji only after a protracted battle and with reduced majority. this is true not only for bjp but to most political parties. sp lost in up sad in punjab and congress in himachal. if exit polls are to be believed even cpm may be losing its stranglehold in tripura. in the present information driven age and increased awareness of people political parties have to worry more about this anti incumbency than even their opponents. voters can no longer be taken for granted.      thank you for your feedback your response is private. is this answer useful        in my humble opinion bjp is losing in bye polls because people have realised that they are not focussing on real growth job creation farmer upliftment etc. the things which matter. hence they are rejecting bjp in bye polls specially where is it in power. and bjp is winning new states on a streak because those states are unaware or the bjp rules reality and are convinced by their pr machinery. if any state for example tripura who recently went to poll is given a chance for reelection there is a chance that bjp wont form govt or at least their vote share will decrease. i think what happened in tripura would have made people realise they made a mistake. similarly people of us realised when they chose trump and britishers realised when they voted marginally in favour of brexit. post brexit survey indicate this. so the next chance they get to vote bjp out they cling to it hence their loss in bye polls. in haryana if you would have asked anyone after  years of bjp rule if they think bjp would return to power most would have said no. so unless the bjp change its functioning and focus on job creation agriculture upliftment arresting fraudsters it is very likely that the results of bye polls will be repeated in . if they mend their ways there is hope for them.

', 'text', ' thursday apr    last update   pm ist the rout of the bjp in the bihar and delhi assembly elections were loudly touted as evidence of the deep roots of the idea of india  so dear to the leftleaning secular intelligentsia. two years later bihar is back in the bjp stable and delhi limps along with arvind kejriwal nursing his  defeat in the delhi municipal elections. in parting ways with his less than kosher partners  lalu prasad yadav and his ilk  and realigning with the bjp bihar chief minister nitish kumar has apparently revised his views on the hobsons choice between aligning with corruption or with communalism. he has now switched to the latter as the lesser evil possibly nudged by prime minister narendra modis public resolve to abolish both by . in the meantime he forfeits the somewhat unlikely halo around him as the leader of a national secular opposition. muslims and dalits also face this choice now  between a clean effective government albeit hindu government or selfserving dynastic patriarchs posing as ersatz secularists. for the bjp ending communalism or casteism means ending the use of narrow votebanks based on traditional identities around which regional parties have grown deep roots like the rjd in bihar bahujan samaj party and the samajwadi party in uttar pradesh. bjps strategy is to consolidate the hindu vote across regional and caste divides to strengthen its majority government at the centre and control enough states to cover twothirds of the voter population. the idea is to become like a mega political mall encompassing diverse shades of opinion. smaller parties like the jdu are welcome to buyin or optout but none would be critical to the bjps survival. the bjp sees no contradiction between resolving to root out communalism whilst consolidating the hindu vote by ending archaic caste divides. it wants muslims and christians both foreign religions to harmonise their religious beliefs to fit seamlessly into the dominant local culture. eating beef and pork is fine in christian majority nagaland. bonding over beef is the custom in kerala but not in uttar pradesh. a more decentralised india can give greater space for making choices about customs and norms more harmoniously at the local government level. but for now the onus is on the minority community in any area to negotiate workable local compromises. detractors of this majoritarian approach say this illustrates the disenfranchised status of minorities  to be fair to muslims and christians this is a stretch. they have been misleadingly nurtured since  into expecting that the indian state shall provide special mechanisms to safeguard their active political participation in view of their numerical disadvantage. they have never encountered a government that is coldly dismissive of their expectations. there is also disagreement on what being secular means. should the state actively shun anything to do with religion as in france or be even handed with all religions as in the uk or should we further refine our version of secularism in which says political theorist rajeev bhargava both the state and religions influence each other. the state actively intervenes in religion  taking over the administration of tirupati or subsidising haj travel for muslims or opening hindu temples to dalits. similarly religion actively influences state action. demolition of the babri masjid in  by karsevaks breached the law. but it was passively watched by the state in deference to hindu sentiment. in  an executive ordinance effectively nullified a supreme court order granting maintenance to shahbano a muslim divorcee which greatly agitated muslim clerics. modern indian popular culture is syncretic but dominantly hindu as best illustrated by bollywood films. our movies cater predominantly to hindu cultural settings often on the backs of filmstars who are muslim. with  per cent of the population being hindu it cannot but be otherwise. similarly the founders of our constitution were prescient in anticipating that hindu sentiment would be politically dominant. article  of the constitution excludes christian and muslim religious and social institutions from state regulation. but it specifically limits the fundamental right of hindus which includes sikhs jains and buddhists to practice religion by allowing the state to intervene for reforming hindu religious institutions. muslims and christians are not the only ones isolated by the hindu revivalism. onefourth of hindus dalits and backward tribal communities are uncomfortable with traditional brahmanical religious practices. often these are just a cover for hanging onto the asymmetric political and social power structures benefiting the upper and the mandalempowered backward castes. babasaheb ambedkar articulated this fear as a dealbreaker for political cohesion. should we be worried by a bjp mega political mall we are schooled to believe that pervasive political power begets authoritarianism. this hypothesis will now be tested. the bjp believes that a national government in which political subinterests defined by gender caste region or religion work the system from within is better than the template version of parliamentary democracy in which active opposition keeps the transgressions of the ruling party in check. the bjp had  million registered members in    per cent of the registered voters. it has a massive majority in the lok sabha and shall replicate this majority in the rajya sabha as legacy upa members retire. the bjp directly controls states comprising  per cent of indias population whilst another  per cent of the population lives in states ruled by allies or jointly with the bjp. together this constitutes more than threefourths of the population. why then does it feel compelled to grow bigger in any competitive market to stand still is to lose ground. indian sporting teams are often criticised for lacking the killer instinct to convert their strengths into wins. but in politics as in business this genetic flaw is an asset. leaving something on the table boosts the feel good factor for all. this has merit in politics where there are no permanent winners or losers.', ' thursday apr    last update   pm ist terming the allegation about involvement of mines and geology minister vinay kulkarni in the murder case of dharwad

addressing mediapersons in nargund town of gadag district on monday he said that the minister is being targeted as he is actively involved in the agitation demanding separate religion status for lingayats. stating that charges are being levelled against the minister in an attempt to weaken the lingayat movement he said that bjp leaders are always lying as they have no other issue to raise against the state government.  the charge levelled against minister vinay kulkarni is a bjp plot to malign him ahead of the assembly elections. they will not succeed in any such conspiracy to damage his image as the minister is innocent. the congress will come to power again after the next election as we have fulfilled all promises made before the previous election said mr siddaramaiah. the chief minister also said that a few bjp leaders have expressed willingness to join the the congress and have been in touch with him. responding to the mahadayi water dispute he said that it is not possible for state bjp president b.s. yeddyurappa to resolve the issue though he has promised to find a solution to it within a month. he also said that the water row can be amicably resolved only with the intervention of prime minister narendra modi and state bjp leaders have been giving assurances with an eye on the forthcoming assembly elections. expressing confidence that the mahadayi water dispute tribunal will give its verdict before august next year he remarked that earlier prime ministers in the country have not behaved like narendra modi in settlement of such disputes in the federal system. water resource minister m b patil said that siddaramaiah should serve as chief minister for a second time after the  elections as the state government under his leadership has made tremendous achievement in all sectors including irrigation. he also alleged that bjp leaders have misled the prime minister over resolving the mahadayi water dispute. meanwhile chief minister siddaramaiah and his cabinet colleagues faced the wrath of mahadayi farmers who raised slogans against the state government urging state congress leaders to persuade aicc president sonia gandhi to find an early

status of religion change and interfaith marriages following the highlypublicised case of a brother challenging his sisters marriage and conversion to islam.  we are of the opinion that while protecting the fundamental right of freedom under article  of the constitution of india some guidelines are necessary to check forcible conversion of religion because religion is a matter of faith and not of logic a bench of justices gopal krishna vyas and virendra kumar mathur said. the court allowed an adult personpeople to convert to a religion of his or her choice with a condition that the individual should satisfy himselfherself about niceties of conversion of religion. every citizen has a fundamental right of freedom of religion under article  of the constitution of india but at the same time it is the duty of every citizen to protect the feelings of other religion and not to act contrary to the provisions of constitution the bench added. the court also made it mandatory for those wishing to convert to inform the district collector or subdivisional magistrate who will in turn put up the information on the office notice board the same day. the court ruling has come in the wake of a case in which a hindu girl payal had converted to islam to marry a muslim boy. the bench was hearing this matter following a habeas corpus petition filed by the girls brother who had said that she was claiming that she had been brainwashed and was a victim of love jihad. though the court had finally allowed the girl to go with her husband since she was an adult it said that it would continue to hear the matter of religious conversion and inter faith marriage. on friday the bench reiterated its earlier views in the case. we are clarifying that this court is also cautious of the fact that payal singhvi and faiz modi are adults and this court deem it appropriate to declare that above guidelines shall not affect their rights as two individuals are adults and they are at liberty to live their life as per their choice the bench said. the guidelines also make it mandatory for the newlyconverted to solemnise the marriage after one week of conversion. the dm will take appropriate action under the law on information of forceful conversion they said.', ' thursday apr    last update   pm ist days after yearold photographer ankit saxena was brutally stabbed to death by the family

government was a party to the case before the court he said displaying orders which showed that the additional solicitor general had appeared on behalf of the central government during the hearing of the case. the modi government is conspiring to violate the rights of dalits and tribals by speaking lies and falsehoods. the scst atrocities act that was brought by the congress and rajiv gandhi has almost been finished at the hands of the modi government and its law ministry congress communications incharge randeep surjewala said. he added that while mr prasad claimed his government was not a party to the case in the supreme court on november   the top court had issued a notice to the central government along with the maharashtra government and again on january   the additional solicitor general had represented the centre and sought more time from the court on behalf of the union government. mr surjewala alleged that mr prasad was trying to mislead the country as part of a bigger conspiracy under an agenda of lies and falsehood. was the government of india protecting the scst act or making it ineffective the fact is that the modi government and law ministry conspired to nullify the scst act under a conspiracy of lies falsehood and deceit. and all this happened at the behest of the prime minister the rss and the bjp who have an antidalit and antitribal mindset he said. mr sharma added that mr shah was trying to portray himself as a champion of the philosophy of dalit icon b r ambedkar but should instead apologise to the country for what his partys government has done to the dalits of india  for the atrocities for the murders for the rapes. the bjp and rsss thinking militates against every aspect of the values and philosophy which dr ambedkar had propounded he said. mr sharma said mr prasad told the media on monday the government of india was not a party to the case before the supreme court. the law minister has made a factually incorrect statement. he should withdraw the statement and apologise for making a wrong statement. it is a matter of concern that the law minister of india is either ignorant of the development that took place in the supreme court...the law minister was wrong in saying that the union of india was not a party they were very much a party he said. mr sharma said the government was represented but they did not argue the case as it opened the window for anticipatory bail. the government endorsed by default by not telling the court that it cannot dilute the law it cannot reinterpret the law it cannot change the law. so the government is a willing party to what has happened he said. violent protests broke out in several states on monday as dalit organisations spearheaded a bharat bandh alleging that the

main attraction a giant cutout of shivakumara swami stands in the heart of tumkur town. for almost a century the powerful siddaganga seminary one of the biggest lingayat centres in karnataka has been based here. its influence is explicit. much of the terrain is tenanted by images and posters commemorating the swamis th birthday. he is the chief of the  among the ten most prominent of a thousand lingayat seminaries that are spread across karnataka. the lingayats form  percent of the population though a census a few years ago that was leaked but not officially reported downsized them to . historically they have been power players on account of not just their numbers but for three decades they have backed the bjp partly because its biggest leader in karnataka bs yeddyurappa is one of their own. but in the next election due in five weeks the congress has thrown a wrench into the works. its chief minister siddaramaiah has called for the lingayats to be recognized as an entire religion separate from hinduism  like jains or buddhists  in a move designed to end the lingayat loyalty to the bjp. under shivakumara swami the in tumkur once a small  has grown into a vast sprawling estate with large land  and several educational institutions attached to it. central to the lingayat tradition is the emphasis on education  the bigger have several schools colleges and hostels linked to them  recognition as a minority religion would entitle them to central government funding that they can disperse according to their own guidelines.  shivakumara swami speaks english and has ensured high literacy levels amongst his followers says anand a devotee who has arrived in tumkur with a busload of relatives in the hope of a with or glimpse of the swami. in our tradition we dont worship blindly we do so because these are enlightened educated people who speak rationally and speak of an inclusive society. the lingayats were formed as a sect in the th century by a social reformer basavanna who rejected the caste system and other rituals of hinduism. they have long contended that they must not be treated as a subset of hindus. championing their demand would put the bjp at odds with the partys ideological mentor the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or rss which holds a unified hindu society as an important ideal. with the congress asking the central government to recognize the lingayats as a religion the reactions of different are being closely gauged by both the congress and the bjp mainly in private conferrals. the head of the powerful chittradurga m recently sent a letter of support for the congress decision that too shortly after bjp chief amit shahs visit to the seminary. so far the siddiganga in tumkur has refused to publicly offer its reaction despite house calls from both amit shah and top congress leaders to shivakumara swami.  mb patil a minister in the congress government and a lingayat himself has been spearheading the movement for its recognition as a religion. at his plush residence in bengaluru there is a constant flow of congress mlas and workers from the lingayat community. shiv shankar from basavakalyan the birthplace of basavanna says we want to make sure our people everywhere understand that the congress is trying to give us our religion back. minority religious status will allow us to give more seats to our community in the institutions we ourselves have created. mobilizing the community around key lingayat issues like that of a separate religion is being done in many ways. the rashtriya bassava sena named after the th century saint whom the lingayats see as the founder of their movement was officially registered three months ago. the organizations members say they have no political affiliation but its being promoted by congress leaders and its office now doubles up as the congress warroom for the election on may . sm jamdar a retired bureaucrat who is one of the key figures in the movement for a separate status said the bassava sena is fashioned as a cultural organization that will work amongst the lingayat youth to counter the rss. the senas general secretary ap bassarajai who is also a leader of the congress youth wing tells ndtv at the moment weve stopped enrollment as the model code of conduct is set in place and we dont want it to seem like our movement is all about politics when it is about spreading the true message of bassava the founder of our faith. the bjps response to the congress move has been muted. bs yeddyurappa who is running for chief minister against siddaramaiah has refused to elaborate the bjps stand on the lingayat issue and leaves it to media incharge and party spokesperson s prakash to field questions. we do not see any impact favourable to the congress party. it is always yeddyurappa who is seen as the tallest lingayat leader. siddaramaiah to deny yeddyurappa chief ministership and to wean away the lingayat vote has created this division.  though the idea of any sect leaving the hindu fold is anathema to its ideology the bjp knows the stakes are too high to oppose the idea of a separate lingayat faith. instead it is riding on the opposition of the veerashaivas. the veerashaivas are loosely termed a subsect of the lingayats but differences in doctrine and caste composition have exacerbated the schism over the past few decades. the veerashaivas subscribe to hindu rituals and the vedas unlike the lingayats. at the veerashaiva mahasabha office which administers the community its general secretary hm prasanna calls siddaramaiahs recommendation for a separate religion unconstitutional. the recommendation defines lingayatism as a separate religion for lingayats and all those who believe in the primacy of basavanna. for the veerashaivas the social reform is important but one of many or saints they believe in.  in support of his stand prassanna points to an earlier demand for a new religion in  which used the term veerashaivalingayat but which did not emphasize basavannas status as the founder. sonia gandhi had come to our office he says pointing to huge blowup of a picture covering half a wall of her with the members of the veerashaiva . she had endorsed our decision for the new religion that is still pending. the congress government says it has been rejected but thats untrue...so now why are they talking about taking veerashaivas out of the new religion the issue is not cleanly divided along party lines either. the president of the mahasabha is a congress leader dr shamanur shivashankarappa he claims siddaramaiah is being unconstitutional in this. we believe in the new religion but only if that clause is removed. we are followers of basavanna but also the . as the recommendation stands today we cannot accept it. on the ground many in both communities use the term interchangeably. it is a complexity carried over into the structures most which have both veerashaiva and lingayat followers. the pictures of the siddiganga seer shivakumara swami hangs prominently at the veerashaiva mahasabha. his views on the issue then have become very critical. but it is unlikely that they will be publicly voiced during this campaign. while shivakumara swami is too old to face questions at the  his junior is categorical that he will not comment on the issue. but he indicates that the swami does not favour schisms between the veerashaivas and the lingayats. the congress may believe it has checkmated the bjp on the issue the tallest lingayat influencers may need much more persuasion.  copyright ndtv convergence

make it clear in this public meeting in the presence of so many people that the bjp will not withdraw reservations at all nor will it allow anyone to do so. the centre on wednesday moved a plea in the supreme court seeking to review the march  verdict putting safeguards on arrest under the stringent scst prevention of atrocities act. the top court asserted that   rather some suggestions have been made to protect innocents and refused to keep in abeyance the verdict. the court also said an arrest made without any preliminary investigation goes against the constitutional right of liberty. the judgment delivered on march  offered some relaxation in two tough provisions of the scst prevention of atrocities act  that a person accused under the law be immediately arrested and not be allowed bail. it led to accusations from dalit groups that the law has been weakened.  copyright ndtv convergence limited . all rights reserved.']
