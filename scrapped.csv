"Tripura’s win is people’s answer to fear, lies, confusion spread against BJP: Modi",deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called the BJP's impressive performance in Tripura Assembly polls people's answer to ""fear, lies and confusion"" being spread against his government, and targeted the Congress, saying it was never so diminished as a party as it is now. Addressing party workers at the BJP's newly constructed headquarters following the announcement of results of polls in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, the Prime Minister also took an apparent dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying some people grow in designation but shrink in stature. In contrast, he said, BJP chief Amit Shah rose by leading the party to victories in many states.  In remarks laced with sarcasm, Narendra Modi said he had recently told Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy that the Congress leader was lucky as he will soon become a ""specimen of a Congress chief minister"" as his party will be in power only in his state by June after losing Karnataka, which goes to the polls in April-May. Referring to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who heads the Congress government in the state, he said neither he nor they (Congress) consider each other their own. ""He is a 'swatantra fauji' (independent soldier),"" Narendra Modi said of Amarinder Singh. The Prime Minister said people of northeast had a sense of alienation but his government worked overtime to remove it. Central ministers have spent more nights in one of these states to deal with their problems in the last four years than they did all the years earlier, he said. ""Fear, lies and confusion were being spread,"" he said, an apparent reference to the opposition's criticism of his government over a host of issues, and now people have answered it through their votes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a brief pause when there was a call for prayers from a nearby mosque, and also paid respects along with the audience to deceased party workers, allegedly victims of political violence, by keeping silence for a while. He was felicitated by senior party functionaries, including members of the BJP parliamentary board, headed by Amit Shah."

"Manik Sarkar can take shelter in WB, Kerala or B'desh: BJP's Himanta Biswa",deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST Outgoing Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar can take shelter in West Bengal, Kerala or neighbouring Bangladesh as the BJP is going to form the next government in the state, Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday. “Manik Sarkar has just three options before him. He can go to West Bengal, where the CPI-M still has some presence. He can go to Kerala, where the party is in power and will rule for three more years or he can go to neighbouring Bangladesh,” Sarma told reporters in Agartala when asked about his comments on Sarkar during an election rally.  The BJP leader had kicked up a row by reportedly saying that the Tripura chief minister would be sent to Bangladesh after the assembly elections in the state. Sarma reportedly made the remark at an election rally in Dhanpur, Sarkar’s constituency, while criticising the state government over the alleged deteriorating law and order situation and cross-border crimes. The 69-year-old chief minister has governed Tripura since 1998. He is a politburo member of CPI-M and has been ruling the state for the fourth consecutive time. Elections in 59 seats, out of the 60-member Tripura assembly, were held on February 18. Election in one seat was countermanded due to the death of the CPI-M candidate. The BJP and its ally Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) were leading in 41 out of the 59 constituencies whose trends were available, according to Election Commission sources in Agartala on Saturday."

KCR’s Modi remark slip of tongue: K T Rama Rao,deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST IT minister K.T. Rama Rao had to cobble together an excuse for his father and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s implied criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has created a storm in a teacup in BJP ranks.  He told a highly indignant defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday that it was a ‘slip of the tongue’ by the CM who should not have put it quite like that. During a meeting in Karimnagar on February 26, the Chief Minister had not minced his words when criticising Mr Modi and referred to him as “that Prime Minister Modi gaadu” (fellow). State BJP leaders took umbrage at this and complained to Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan that such a term was “unsavoury” and “unparliamentary.” They even sent reports to central BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister himself, with a translation of the CM’s comments. The defence minister, who was in the city on Thursday evening, told the press that she had almost decided not to come when she came to know “about the comments made by one constitutional authority like Chief Minister against another constitutional authority like Prime Minister.”  Ms Sitharaman said that despite having ideological differences, one should not address the Prime Minister in such a manner. She said even if it is a slip of the tongue, the Chief Minister should have given an explanation. “I was invited to Hyderabad to attend a defence-related programme on Thursday. On Wednesday, I called IT minister K.T. Rama Rao who was in Nalgonda on tour and raised objection over the comments. I told him I am unable to understand whether I should come or not. It wouldn’t look good if I participate in the programme after the Prime Minister was belittled by the CM. “I came today and attended the function along with the minister and again I spoke to him about this. Then K.T. Rama Rao garu told me ‘it was just a slip of the tongue, my father will not speak in that way’. I participated because Make in India from Telangana will have a huge impact on the aerospace industry.” “We can give responses to ideological criticism if they have been said in appropriate manner,” she said.  “It is sad that a CM spoke like this. We felt very sad and even the co-untry should feel sad,” Ms Sitharaman said."

N Chandrababu Naidu joins parties in call for no-trust move against Modi,deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST Both the ruling and Opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh are talking about moving a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi Government to protest the raw deal Andhra Pradesh got in the Union Budget. The idea of the no-trust motion was first mooted by Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan who has no MPs. He said the TD and YSR Congress should both move the motion so that the Modi government will talk terms with Andhra Pradesh’s MPs.  The idea was picked up by Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy who said that his party MPs will move a no-confidence motion and it is for Pawan Kalyan to enlist support for the motion including from the ruling TDP. Given the one-upmanship presently being displayed by the rival TDP and YSRCP, it is doubtful that they can unite in moving the no-trust motion in Parliament. On Monday, TD Chief and AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did mention the No Confidence Motion on two occasions. He first said that it would be of no use and later corrected his statement and said a no-trust move should be the last opportunity after exploring all other options. The fact of the matter is that unless the TD breaks  its alliance with the BJP-led NDA government at the centre first, it cannot move a no-trust motion. However, Pawan Kalyan on Monday evening again said it is his responsibility to muster support for the move and he will go to Delhi and talk to all other opposition parties in the Lok Sabha to garner support."

"BJP demolishes Left Front in Tripura, Biplab Deb likely to be new CM",deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST The Left Front’s 25-year-old rule in Tripura came to an end on Saturday with BJP and its alliance partner Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) sweeping the assembly polls by winning 43 seats and leaving CPI(M) at distant second with 16 seats only. It was a huge turnaround for BJP, which had no MLAs in the 60-member House and had got only around 1.7 per cent votes in the assembly elections in 2013.  The Congress, which over the years had played the second fiddle in the state and has been in power twice, has failed to open its account and its candidates forfeiting their security deposits on majority of the seats. Crediting the favourable results to the hard work of party workers of Tripura in the last three years, Assam education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was one of the key architects of BJP’s victory in Northeastern states, said that merger of Trinamool Congress' Tripura unit with the BJP was the most significant factor which consolidated the opposition and anti-CPM votes across the state. Though, BJP had not declared any chief ministerial candidate, it is believed that Tripura BJP president Biplab Deb would succeed chief minister Manik Sarkar. Deb, a gym instructor-turned-politician, thanked the people of Tripura for their overwhelming support and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah with the party's showing. ""I am ready to take the responsibility. I will not run away from taking any responsibility,"" he told reporters when asked if he would accept the task of chief ministership. However, the BJP leader reiterated that the BJP Parliamentary Board, which would meet in New Delhi in the evening, would take a final decision on the next chief minister of Tripura. ""I have already been given a bigger responsibility, the party’s state presidentship, which I have been fulfilling to the best of my ability,"" Deb said. Deb said the people of Tripura favourably responded to the BJP's call to root out the CPI(M) government, which has been ruling the  state for more than two decades. ""People responded favourably to our call call 'Chalo Paltai' (Let's Change),"" he said. Deb said that the next government's priority would be all-round development of Tripura and people voted for the BJP as there had been total backwardness in the state under the Manik Sarkar government. ""The word development does not exist in the dictionary of the CPI(M). Our government will provide good governance and time-bound implementation of all developmental works,"" Deb said. The BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said, “Our Parliamentary Board will meet in New Delhi and take a call on issue of selecting the chief minister.” It is significant that BJP contested Tripura elections on local issues and ignored its “Hindutava” plank in the campaign. This was more visible when party brought Maharaja Colonel Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarman Bahadur of the Manikya dynasty into focus. The last reigning monarch of the princely state before it merged with the Indian Republic in 1949, Bir Bikram is credited with planning the kingdom’s capital of Agartala, initiating land reforms, reserving vast tracts of land for Tripura’s tribal population, building Agartala’s first airport and setting up one of the country’s first municipalities and university. The BJP in-charge of Tripura Sunil Deodhar who played the key role in victory of the party, said, “Maharaja Bir Bikram was a vikas purush, an extraordinary man. He did so much for Tripura but has never received that kind of attention. We are trying to get him the Bharat Ratna. We are also trying to ensure that the Agartala airport is named after him.’’ The BJP strategists laid focus on non-development of the frontier state where unemployment and non-compliance of pay commission’s recommendation for state government employees became a major issue. In fact of the three states, Tripura was also the most keenly watched for being the last Left bastion in the country. The 69-year-old outgoing chief minister Manik Sarkar, has governed Tripura since 1998. A politburo member of CPI(M), he had been at the helm for the fourth consecutive time. Besides tapping into the youth, the BJP made aggressive best efforts to break the CPI(M)’s stranglehold in 20 seats reserved for tribals, which possibly turned the ride in its favour. The BJP led alliance has succeeded in winning all the 20 tribal reserved seats. The IPFT general secretary Mewat Jamatia has won from the Asharambari seat with a massive margin of 7,000 votes. It is significant that BJP had contested 50 seats in the last assembly polls in 2013 and its candidates forfeited their deposits on 49 seats. However, with just 1.87 per cent of votes, it failed to win any seat in the state. The CPI(M) had won 49 of the 55 seats it contested while the Congress managed to win 10 out of 48 seats it contested. Though, CPM was voted out of power, it succeeded in retaining 43 per cent vote share whereas BJP made significant jump in vote bank by securing 42.8 per cent votes from its dismal performance of 2013 in which it has got 1.5 per cent of votes. The BJP got the lead with vote share of its alliance partner IPFT, which polled 7.7 per cent votes The Left, after voted out of power in a statement, “The BJP has, apart from other factors, utilised massive deployment of money and other resources to influence the elections. The BJP was able to consolidate all the anti-Left votes, virtually appropriating the erstwhile main opposition party, the Congress.” The party’s polit bureau also thanked the 45 per cent people that supported the Left Front, and said it would take remedial measures after carefully examining the reasons for its loss."

"West Bengal CM slams Amit Shah, blames CPI(M), Cong for BJP's win in Tripura",deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST Discounting BJP's massive success in the Assembly Elections in Tripura West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of winning the neighbouring state with the help of outsiders, money power and the central para-military forces. Hitting out at BJP President Amit Shah for his next targets of winning three more states — West Bengal, Odhisa and Karnataka the Trinamool Congress supremo wondered if the BJP would be able to continue at the Centre after the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.  Mamata Banerjee, who recently said she would be happy if the CPI(M) would win the Assembly Elections in Tripura, revealed that she gave an offer to Congress President Rahul Gandhi of an alliance and seat-sharing which was rejected. Blaming the Congress and the CPI(M) she observed that it was not the BJP's victory in Tripura. The CPI(M)'s arrogance and the Congress' failure were the results of the assembly polls, she noted adding that had the Congress not turned down her proposal for an alliance, the results may have been otherwise. Hinting at foul play she alleged that something unnatural has happened in the Tripura polls which has made its results a ‘mystery’. “I do not see any reason for the BJP to be emphatic over its victory in the Assembly polls in Tripura. The CPI(M) bagged 45 per cent of the total votes. It is no less. And the BJP got 50 per cent votes. What you are not saying is that in the North Eastern states power is grabbed with the help of source and force whoever stays in power at the Centre. I have only one objection which I spoke about in the Assembly recently,” she said at state secretariat Nabanna on Saturday evening. Mamata Banerjee alleged, “They (BJP) spent huge amount of money. Many incidents took place over EVMs. They brought outsiders to Tripura apart from misusing the central forces there. But I need to know why the CPI(M) did not protest. The CPI(M) totally surrendered itself to the BJP. Had they not surrendered, the results would not have been bad. There was a difference of only five cent votes. While the Congress suffered failures, the CPI(M) surrendered.” The Trinamool chief claimed, “If you ask about the Congress' failures, I would say that I bought a change in 1987 in Tripura. It is not that change did not take place ever there. It is wrong which is being circulated in the social network. After the change in 1987 in Tripura the atmosphere was set for another change in 1992 when Prime Minister Narsimha Rao imposed the President's Rule at the behest of the CPI(M). Had it not been so, the Congress would have come to power then again.” She added, “So there are instances in the history. Incumbency creeped in as the Left Front has been in the politics for a long time. Had the Congress given a tough fight, the difference bagging of four-five votes would not have been a big matter. In that case the BJP would have got only ten seats. Today I disclose that I made a request to the Congress. I personally told Rahul Gandhi: Look we are new in Tripura and we are yet to do anything there. I urged him to take part in the fight jointly Congress and Trinamul alongwith the hill-based parties.” The West Bengal chief minister reasoned, “But they did not do it. I even suggested them for a seat adjustment which covered 14 seats to be contested by us and 16 others to be contested by the hill-based parties while the Congress would contest in 30 seats. This would have led to the creation of a platform. Had the platform been created, the difference in vote percentage would not have happened. But the Congress did nothing. I do not know why the Congress supplied oxygen to the BJP.” She mentioned, “I am saying all these now because I gave it a thought and I pursued it also. I do not know at whose advice they did not accept my proposal. As a result the Congress vote percentage now stands at around two per cent. It is shame for them because they were the opposition party there.”"

"Himanta Biswa Sarma is BJP’s man in Northeast, again",deccan," Saturday, Mar 03, 2018 | Last Update : 11:18 PM IST The man with the gloating rights today for solidly establishing the BJP in Northeast politics is party strategist Himanta Biswa Sarma. A former Congress man, Sarma has already delivered Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh to the party’s kitty, and continues to work towards what he calls ""mainstreaming the northeast region"" in the country’s politics.   He told a news channel before counting on Saturday, “If we win Tripura and regain Nagaland, have a government in Meghalaya, our expansion in Northeast is complete.” The only other state Mizoram, is ruled by the Congress and goes to polls later this year. Results for the three states now show that the BJP has won Tripura – ending Left Front chief minister Manik Sarkar’s two-decade rule – won Nagaland with partner NDPP and can swing a coalition in Meghalaya where the ruling Congress doesn’t look it will get a majority. He said: “In Meghalaya, we have to talk among parties and install non-Congress government."" Sarma joined the BJP in 2015, and swung a massive victory in Assam for the party. In 2017, he effected a BJP government in Manipur, thought the BJP did not win a majority in the state. In Arunachal Pradesh, he broke the Congress, spirited away 40 rebel MLAs to form a party at the Assembly that is supported by the BJP. Sarma told , “I am in the BJP for this. The enormous attention Prime Minister Narendra Modi and (BJP president) Amit Shah are paying the Northeast is extraordinary,"" he said. “In my entire political life, I have never seen a national political party pay so much attention to the northeast. It is about winning the hearts of the people of the northeast. People are very happy about this.”"

"In Karti Chidambaram Case, Indrani Mukerjea Brings Up Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram",ndtv," Sections | Reported by , Edited by |  Indrani Mukerjea, who once owned the television company at the heart of the CBI case against Karti Chidambaram, has told the Enforcement Directorate that she and Peter Mukerjea had met former Union Minister P Chidambaram to seek government approval to foreign investment proposals worth around Rs. 300 crore in the company INX Media. Ms Mukerjea's statement, also made separately to the CBI and recorded before a magistrate, has linked the former Union Finance Minister to the CBI case filed against Karti Chidambaram, 46. Karti Chidambaram, who was arrested on Wednesday morning, is accused of receiving kickbacks in 2007 to clear the foreign investment, using the influence of his father, who was then the Union finance minister. At the time, the company was owned by Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The couple has been in jail on charges of murdering her daughter Sheena Bora since 2015. NDTV has also accessed invoices that the investigating agencies said are proof of the payments made to Karti Chidambaram. Investigators said they got the invoices after they arrested Karti Chidambaram's chartered accountant two weeks ago. The former Union Minister and his son have denied the allegations, calling it a case of ""political vendetta"" and pointing that it was Mr Chidambaram, who as Finance Minister in 2013, had first ordered a probe by the Serious Frauds Office into allegations against the INX Group. Investigators told NDTV that Peter and Indrani Mukerjea had given statements to the Enforcement Directorate detailing their interactions with the former Union Minister and his son. Ms Mukerjea later, according to an official note, also ""confirmed payment of 7,00,000 dollars"" in her statement recorded before a magistrate. In their statements, Indrani Mukerjea and Peter Mukerjea say they had met P Chidambaram in his office in the North Block. They allege he had asked them to help the business of Karti Chidambaram and to ""make foreign remittances"" for this purpose. Subsequently, they met Karti Chidambaram at Delhi's Hyatt hotel, who allegedly demanded a payment of 1 million dollars. ""It was further admitted that Karti Chidambaram suggested the names of Chess Management and Advantage Strategic as alternatives to make payments,"" a document accessed by NDTV read. The CBI had filed a case against Karti Chidambaram last year, in which he has been accused of accepting bribes to the tune of 10 lakh. In court on Wednesday, Karti Chidambaram's lawyer, Congress lawmaker Abhishek Manu Singhvi, said he was being targeted because he was the senior Congress leader's son. Regarding the bribe allegation, Mr Singhvi said Karti Chidambaram was not a director or a shareholder of Advantage Strategic company, one of the companies through which the Mukerjeas had allegedly paid the bribe. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018.

"BJP's Karnataka Hope BS Yeddyurappa Is 75; Party Says Age Bar ""Unofficial""",ndtv," Sections | | Written by |  On Tuesday, as former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa turned 75, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a rally in Karnataka in a symbolic boost to the state BJP chief's election campaign in the southern state. The BJP has also projected Mr Yeddyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate in Congress-ruled Karnataka. But there could be a catch -- the BJP is said to have a cut-off of 75 years for anyone who wants to contest elections, though party president Amit Shah has denied any such age limit. ""It is not a mandatory policy in the BJP constitution. It is only unofficial guidelines followed by the party. There have been exceptions in the past as well,"" BJP spokesperson S Prakash told NDTV. Senior BJP leaders said Mr Yeddyurappa was not 75 when he was chosen as the chief ministerial candidate and as someone who would lead the party in the Karnataka assembly election. Mr Yeddyurappa's party has said he also is the only sitting Member of Parliament who has been allowed to contest the Karnataka assembly election. If the party does come to power in Karnataka, he would, however, need to be a legislator to be the chief minister. The Congress has now taken hold of the issue to attack the BJP in a bid to create confusion in the rival party as part of its election offensive. Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao said the BJP ""is just using him (Mr Yeddyurappa) because they have nobody else in Karnataka."" ""This is an internal matter of the BJP. But knowing our Prime Minister, the reason why he came yesterday (to Karnataka) was to say goodbye to Yeddyurappa... I think after the elections, whatever happens, this would be the final function Yeddyurappa is having,"" Mr Rao told NDTV. The Election Commission has said the dates for the Karnataka assembly election would be announced around April 15.  ................... Advertisement ................... ...................

Earlier this month, the CBI booked Modi, his wife Ami, brother Nishal, and uncle Mehul Choksi (all partners of three companies: Diamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds) in Rs 280 crore fraud case.

"Private bus fares zoom as tickets include toll fee, accident claim | Chennai News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," CHENNAI: After an initial delay due to lack of clarity, private mofussil buses in have started collecting toll plaza user fee and accident compensation claim amount from passengers. The state transport department had earlier revised norms allowing private operators to collect Rs 1 for every Rs 25 collected from passengers towards ticket sales.  However, there was no clarity about the rates among some of the operators. Now that it has been sorted out, fares have been revised in all private moffusil buses.  D R Dharmaraj, general secretary of Federation of Bus Operators’ Associations of Tamil Nadu said, “This is a welcome move as we (operators) were not able to break even because of the increased toll fees. Our profits would go up with this change.”  Passengers are forced to shell out extra on bus fares, said K from a CITU-affiliated state transport union.  Responding to this, a transport department official said it would be legally incorrect to have different fare slabs for private and government buses and courts might have directed us to do the same had private operators approached them. “Also, occupancy rate in government buses will come down if private buses collect less fare,”” he added.  On the other hand, advocate VS , who handles road accident related cases in the Madras high court, said setting up a fund with the money collected would help in quicker settlement of accident claims.  Despite government allocating Rs 190 crore towards accident claims, more than 400 buses are still under judicial custody for non-payment of dues.  Experts say the financial burden on the state would have been under control if they had brought an insurance cover. None of the 22,000 government buses have third-party or comprehensive insurance coverage. They have been let off the radar by traffic enforcement authorities. However, they turn very stringent when it comes to other private vehicles.  On an average, 1,700 vehicles are detained a month for want of third party insurance certificates. According data, a total of 16,800 vehicles were penalised for the said traffic offence and 200 are under police custody in Tamil Nadu.     Be the first one to review.

"Narendra Modi: From being 'no one', BJP has 'won' today: PM Narendra Modi on northeast poll results | India News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," NEW DELHI: Addressing party workers at the newly-built BJP's headquarter in New Delhi, a triumphant PM today dedicated the results of the assembly election in northeast to their hard work and lauded the journey of the party from being a “no one” to a party which, of late, has become synonymous with winning elections.  “From being ‘no one’, BJP has won today,” the PM said.        The Prime Minister began his address with a minute silence in memory of the party workers killed in political violence in various states of the country.  ""Be it Kerala, Bengal or Karnataka, the way two dozen workers were murdered there, when they can't fight to the face, they stoop down to this. Still we maintained silence. When we take action they cry 'vendetta'. This isn't vendetta but a mandate,"" the PM said.  Attributing the success of the BJP to its workers, the PM said that they have been instrumental in party's transformation.  ""It is because of the hard work of the party workers that BJP has emerged as a sprawling “Banyan Tree” across the country,"" he said.        Today, BJP dethroned the 25-year-old Left government in Tripura. The saffron party's victory in Tripura is quite certain, and if it forms the government in Nagaland as well, the tally of BJP-ruled states will go up to 21.  At the start of his address, Modi took a brief pause when there was a call for prayers from a nearby mosque. He was also felicitated by senior party functionaries, including members of the BJP parliamentary board, headed by party president Amit Shah.  Here is a look at important points from PM Modi's speech:   * ""To win or to lose in elections are a part of democracy. That is the beauty of democracy. One must accept their defeat with a sporting spirit.""  * ""In ‘Vastu Shastra’, it is said that Northeast of a house is at the Centre. Things are organised keeping Northeast in mind. Similarly, our Northeast will lead the country’s development journey.""  * ""I do not have the figures but I think the elected team in Tripura is the youngest ever team. Some of them were even scared that would be rejected on the grounds of their age. Such young candidates successfully won people's confidence.""  * ""The Maoist ideology used fear and myth as weapons to the will of the people. The people of Tripura have responded to that fear by using their right to vote.""  * ""The Sun is red at the time of sunset and turns saffron when it rises.""  * ""At one point in time, BJP did not have structured organisation on the ground in many parts of the country. But today, it has spread to every nook and corner of the country due to sheer hard work and dedication of millions of selfless karyakartas.""  * ""Congress party will be virtually left with only one CM in Puducherry in the country after they will be defeated in Karnataka in June 2018. In any case, Congress party doesn’t treat Punjab CM as their own, nor does Capt. Amrinder Singh treat Congress as his own.""  * ""The Congress party has shrunk to its lowest ever size ever. There is a lesson to be learnt from this for other political parties, especially the BJP. We must not let ‘Congress culture’ creep in our party.""   In Video:   Be the first one to review.

NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP came under attack from opposition parties over the fraud case and was accused of abetting jewellery designer 's swindle and subsequent flight from the country.   president took a jab at PM Modi with a tweet titled ""Guide to Looting India"", in which he alleged that Nirav Modi had wielded his influence with the PM to get away with the Rs 280 crore fraud.     ""Guide to Looting India by Nirav MODI 1. Hug PM Modi 2. Be seen with him in DAVOS Use that clout to: A. Steal 12,000Cr B. Slip out of the country like Mallya, while the Govt looks the other way,"" Rahul tweeted with the hastag ""From 1 Modi to Another"".         Party spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi had tweeted the image of the Prime Minister together with Nirav Modi at Davos earlier this year.         Taking to Twitter, Congress communications in-charge questioned whether it was the NDA government's norm to let embezzlers run away with the taxpayers' money.     ""Who is Nirav Modi? The new #ModiScam? Was he tipped off like Lalit Modi and to escape by someone within the government? Has it become the norm for letting people run away with public money? Who is responsible?,"" tweeted Surjewala.  Delhi CM and AAP chief alleged that the ruling party was complicit in Nirav Modi's escape, also citing the precedent of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya.

Modi (46), who had figured in the Forbes' list of richest Indians, was booked by the CBI for cheating after PNB sent a complaint to it alleging that the jewellery firm owner, his brother, wife and Choksi entered into a criminal conspiracy with the officials of the bank and cheated it, causing a ""wrongful loss"".  The agency, they said, would probe if the allegedly defrauded bank funds were laundered and these proceeds of crime were subsequently used by the accused to create illegal assets and black money.

"Sunil Deodhar: Sunil Deodhar: The man who scripted BJP's Tripura victory | India News - Times of India
			",timesofindia," In an especially stunning performance in Tripura, the party dislodged the Left Front's 25-year rule in the state, easily crossing the half-way mark with over 40 seats in the 60-seat Assembly. MUMBAI: Prime Minister today said that the 's performance in the elections in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya had helped it go to a party which has become synonymous with winning elections.  In an especially stunning performance in Tripura, the party dislodged the Left Front's 25-year rule in the state, easily crossing the half-way mark with over 40 seats in the 60-seat Assembly.  And the party could have one man to thank for the victory: 52-year-old Mumbaikar .  The former RSS man was appointed the BJP's state in-charge of Tripura in November 2014.  Speaking exclusively to Maharashtra Times Online from Agartala, Deodhar, who has been working in the northeast since 1991, shared that he focussed on building a formidable structure, up from the booth-level, spending atleast 15 days every month in Tripura.  He also credited his previous experience in the northeast, including the eight years he spent in Meghalaya as an RSS pracharak, as significant in today's victory.  When asked if he will become the next chief minister of Tripura, Deodhar categorically dismissed all speculation. In fact, he asserted that even if the party approaches him for the top position, he will turn it down.  He, however, did thank party president for putting his faith in him.  Deodhar accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) government led by Manik Sarkar in the state of having done nothing for the people of Tripura.  ""67 per cent of the people are still below poverty line. The people were frustrated but had no other alternative,"" he charged.  The , Deodhar asserts, was not an option, since it needs the help of the CPM at the Centre.  ""In this situation, PM Modi gave them hope with his people-centric policies.""  ""Manik Sarkar had a clean, non-corrupt image. We worked to exposed that image,"" Deodhar added.  The former RSS man shared that the top priorities of the new BJP government in Tripura would include the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission and the improvement of the state's law and order situation.  Deodhar previously managed PM Modi's Lok Sabha campaign in Varanasi in 2014 and also played a crucial role in the 2013 elections in Delhi.

"Hafiz Saeed: Pakistan govt is taking extreme action against us to please India, US - Times of India",timesofindia," Under pressure to act against banned groups, Pakistan took control of a seminary and four dispensaries run by Saeed-linked Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FIF). LAHORE: Mumbai attack mastermind has said he will challenge the government's ""illegal"" action in the court of law after Pakistan launched a crackdown on seminaries and health facilities run by him.   , Pakistan took control of a seminary and four dispensaries run by Saeed-linked (JuD) and (FIF).  ""After detaining me for 10 months without any legal ground, the government has now issued a notification regarding taking over our schools, dispensaries, ambulances and other assets. It will hamper our relief operations in Punjab, Balochistan, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and northern areas,"" Saeed said after the government's action.  According to the interior ministry notification, a copy of which available with PTI, ""the federal government is pleased to direct that requisite actions with regard to freezing and taking over of assets (movable, immovable and human resource) associated with JuD and FIF shall be taken in pursuance of Ordinance No II of 2018.""  The notification issuance date is February 10.  Punjab provincial law minister Rana Sanaullah has also said that on the interior ministry's directions, Hafiz Saeed and his charities have been banned to operate in Pakistan and the government have already started taking over all the facilities, offices, schools, dispensaries and seminaries that belong to the JuD and FIF.  In a message to his workers, Saeed appealed for calm and asked them not to give any violent reaction to the government action against their charities.

Modi made all states beggars: K Chandrasekhar Rao,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government of turning states into beggars by arrogating all powers to itself. He also accused the Central government of juggling with the high tax devolution to states it takes credit for.  Speaking in the Legisla-tive Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Rao said, “On one hand, they claim to be giving 42 per cent highest tax devolution to states. On the other hand, they cut down funds Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) drastically. So, the benefit of higher tax devolution does not reach the states as the states have to bear the additional expenditure on CSS.” He also came down heavily on the NDA government for burdening states with the Uday scheme. “They made tall claims of making power distribution companies in states debt-free under the Uday scheme. But that debt burden was passed on to the states. The Telangana government had to take over a `9,000 crore debt burden of the discoms under the Uday scheme,” he said. He said that the previous UPA regime had started model schools in all states, but the NDA government stopped the scheme all of a sudden. “Now the financial burden to maintain these schools and pay salaries to staff is borne by the states. In this way, one government at the Centre starts schemes and another government stops them abruptly. States are forced to face the consequences on account of such unilateral decisions,” he pointed out."

K Chandrasekhar Rao picks nephew for Rajya Sabha candidate,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and TS Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced the party’s candidates for three Rajya Sabha seats on Sunday. Polling will be held on March 23. As expected, the CM’s nephew and Telugu news channel managing director, Joginapally Santosh Kumar (old Karimnagar district), has been nominated. The other two candidates are the party’s Backward Class leaders, Badugula Lingaiah Yadav (old Nalgonda district) and Banda Prakash (old Warangal district).  Mr Santosh Kumar was earlier elevated to general secretary of the TRS. Going by the existing numbers in the Legislative Assembly, the TRS can easily win all the three seats. To win a Rajya Sabha seat, it requires the support of 30 MLAs. The Congress has only 12 MLAs in the 120-member state Assembly, and the TRS has 89 members. The MIM has seven members, the BJP has five MLAs, the TDP has two MLAs and the CPM has one MLA. However, with the main Opposition Congress deciding to field former Union minister Balaram Naik as a fourth candidate, the elections have taken an interesting turn. Mr Santosh, who has been working with the Chief Minister ever since the TRS was established in 2001, has maintained a low profile all these years. He came into the limelight only after he was made managing director of a Telugu news channel, owned by KCR’s family members, a few years ago, and made general secretary of the TRS. Mr Santosh has the backing of several TRS leaders and activists who requested Mr Rao to give him the Rajya Sabha seat. The TRS won 63 seats in the 2014 elections; its strength increased to 89 with the defection of MLAs from the TDP, Congress, BSP, YSRCP and CPI."

Chandrasekhar Rao and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Sonia Gandhi’s dinner is creating interest in political circles.

Karnataka: Trial run for 2019?,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST With elections in Karnataka set for May 12, the two major parties, Congress and BJP, already in the thick of electioneering, will pull out all the stops for victory. Seen as a trial run for the bigger contest in 2019, preceded by polls in BJP-run Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh later this year, Karnataka could be a harbinger of which side the nation will embrace, as the BJP goes all out to secure a state it once proclaimed as its gateway to the South. Congress CM Siddaramaiah is seeking a record second term, a feat not achieved by any government since JD(U)’s Ramakrishna Hegde called snap polls and won in 1985. The shouting match between the Congress and the JD(S) father-son duo of H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy underlines the Vokkaliga-backed third power centre’s ability to play game-changer. The parties’ internal surveys posit roughly similar forecasts; giving the Congress an edge in 100 of 224 Assembly seats, the BJP in about 70-90; and the JD(S) to take a beating and yet play kingmaker. This raises the possibility of the BJP and JD(S) revisiting their old alliance, which went awry as Mr Kumaraswamy reneged on it, giving the BJP’s B.S. Yeddyurappa the chance to ride to victory in 2008.  For the BJP, Siddaramaiah’s goodies for farmers and others, whom the BJP is avidly wooing, and the CM’s move to break the BJP’s Lingayat base with its ploy of a separate religion tag, could complicate the caste-class calculus. BJP chief Amit Shah’s faux pas in calling Mr Yeddyurappa one of the most corrupt notwithstanding, Karnataka’s propensity to vote against the national trend is a definite possibility, in a poll just 45 days away.

"Congress a notional party, says K T Rama Rao",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Information technology minister K.T. Rama Rao said in a press interaction on Thursday that attempts by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to forge a Third Front by mobilising the support of all opposition parties will not materialise in the backdrop of the recent Uttar Pradesh byelection results, where the two main national parties, the Congress and BJP, were thrashed by the people. Instead, he pushed the claims of the Third Front mooted by his father and CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao. He said the people of the country are waiting for a new front but they do not believe BJP and Congress. The proposed front by K Chandrasekhar Rao will fill this gap. “If any attempts are made by anyone to forge a Third Front by involving BJP or Congress, they would meet the same fate as people are fed up with national parties, which failed miserably in the last 70 years. They want regional parties which are stronger to join hands and take the lead in forging the Third Front,” Mr Rama Rao said.  He also criticised Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu for saying that Telangana state was granted based on ‘sentiment’ and not on scientific grounds. “Naidu should refrain from making such comments. We have no objection to Naidu fighting for special status for AP. But he should not belittle Telangana people or Telangana movement,” Mr Rao remarked."

Sonia Gandhi has decided to host dinner to all Opposition parties on March 13 in Delhi. In fact, TD and TRS leaders were not expecting an invitation from the Congress to the dinner. The TD in Andhra Pradesh and TRS in Telangana are arch rivals of the Congress. Both have decided not to attend the dinner even if they receive an invitation.  TRS chief and Telangana state Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is busy with the formation of the Third Front as alternative to the BJP and the Congress at the National-level. “I don’t think the Congress will extend an invitation to the TRS. We are also not expecting an invitation from the Congress,” TRS MP A.P. Jitendar Reddy said. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, he said that if at all Congress invites them for the dinner, they will not attend. Meanwhile, TD MP C.M. Ramesh said that they did not receive any invitation from the Congress for the dinner."

Political Gup-Shup: Of VIP culture & true followers of Mahatma,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Delivering the valedictory speech at the plenary session of the Congress last week, an impassioned party president Rahul Gandhi declared that his first task was to break the “two walls” in Indian politics — the wall between party workers and leaders, and the wall between the youth and political system. But these reassuring words meant little for the delegates, who travelled from across the country to participate in the two-day jamboree. The hard reality is that despite all the talk about ushering in change, the old system remains very much in place. Delegates pointed out that if Mr Gandhi was serious about breaking barriers, he would have begun by doing away with the separate enclosures for workers and leaders, which ensured there was little or no interaction between them at the session. Not only were the delegates and leaders seated in demarcated enclosures, they were also segregated into separate halls during meal times, which is normally an occasion for workers to mingle freely with leaders. Congress delegates said plenary sessions were originally meant to serve as an excellent occasion for workers to meet with their leaders, but the VIP culture, they said, had taken away the joy. As one member pointed out: “When there’s such a lack of communication within the party, how are we expected to communicate with the public?” Ever since it came to power four years ago, the BJP has made systematic attempts to appropriate the icons of the Congress. While Sardar Patel has been coopted as their leader, the BJP has also been working overtime to project itself as the inheritor of Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. For instance, BJP president Amit Shah recently came up with a series of reasons to argue that their party is the true follower of the Mahatma. For one, he pointed out, like Gandhi, the BJP is not apologetic about being seen in the company of rich people. In this connection, Mr Shah pointed to Gandhi’s association with leading industrialists like the Birlas and Bajajs during the freedom struggle. Though there were no television news channels in those days, Mr Shah said Gandhi was extremely conscious of the role played by the media in propagating their viewpoint.  Mr Shah recalled that Gandhi even delayed the start of his famous Dandi March to await the arrival of a correspondent of a foreign news agency. The BJP president said Gandhi was very particular about optics and this, he said, was even reflected in the manner in which he posed for cameras. The BJP, he said, had imbibed these lessons well from Gandhi, which made their party his real followers. Ever since senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh’s Narmada yatra came in for appreciation from the people, a host of party leaders made it a point to join the senior leader on this parikrama. Last week, former Rajasthan chief minister and Congress general-secretary Ashok Gehlot put in an appearance at Mr Singh’s yatra. Mr Gehlot’s presence led to considerable speculation in about the reason for his trip. Currently a favourite of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, there was a buzz that Mr Gehlot may be carrying a message for Mr Singh from the party chief. It is speculated that Mr Gandhi may have sent  Mr Gehlot as his emissary to ferret out information about Mr Singh’s future plans. Though he has described his six-month yatra, as a “non-political” exercise, those who know Mr Singh are convinced that he planned to use this effort to connect politically with the people of his home state who had rejected him in 2003. The Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh are due this year-end and there are signs that Mr Singh is not going to sit on the sidelines during these crucial polls. Mr Gandhi had better watch out, given Mr Singh’s penchant for creating trouble."

"BJP demolishes Left Front in Tripura, Biplab Deb likely to be new CM",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST The Left Front’s 25-year-old rule in Tripura came to an end on Saturday with BJP and its alliance partner Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) sweeping the assembly polls by winning 43 seats and leaving CPI(M) at distant second with 16 seats only. It was a huge turnaround for BJP, which had no MLAs in the 60-member House and had got only around 1.7 per cent votes in the assembly elections in 2013.  The Congress, which over the years had played the second fiddle in the state and has been in power twice, has failed to open its account and its candidates forfeiting their security deposits on majority of the seats. Crediting the favourable results to the hard work of party workers of Tripura in the last three years, Assam education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was one of the key architects of BJP’s victory in Northeastern states, said that merger of Trinamool Congress' Tripura unit with the BJP was the most significant factor which consolidated the opposition and anti-CPM votes across the state. Though, BJP had not declared any chief ministerial candidate, it is believed that Tripura BJP president Biplab Deb would succeed chief minister Manik Sarkar. Deb, a gym instructor-turned-politician, thanked the people of Tripura for their overwhelming support and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah with the party's showing. ""I am ready to take the responsibility. I will not run away from taking any responsibility,"" he told reporters when asked if he would accept the task of chief ministership. However, the BJP leader reiterated that the BJP Parliamentary Board, which would meet in New Delhi in the evening, would take a final decision on the next chief minister of Tripura. ""I have already been given a bigger responsibility, the party’s state presidentship, which I have been fulfilling to the best of my ability,"" Deb said. Deb said the people of Tripura favourably responded to the BJP's call to root out the CPI(M) government, which has been ruling the  state for more than two decades. ""People responded favourably to our call call 'Chalo Paltai' (Let's Change),"" he said. Deb said that the next government's priority would be all-round development of Tripura and people voted for the BJP as there had been total backwardness in the state under the Manik Sarkar government. ""The word development does not exist in the dictionary of the CPI(M). Our government will provide good governance and time-bound implementation of all developmental works,"" Deb said. The BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said, “Our Parliamentary Board will meet in New Delhi and take a call on issue of selecting the chief minister.” It is significant that BJP contested Tripura elections on local issues and ignored its “Hindutava” plank in the campaign. This was more visible when party brought Maharaja Colonel Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarman Bahadur of the Manikya dynasty into focus. The last reigning monarch of the princely state before it merged with the Indian Republic in 1949, Bir Bikram is credited with planning the kingdom’s capital of Agartala, initiating land reforms, reserving vast tracts of land for Tripura’s tribal population, building Agartala’s first airport and setting up one of the country’s first municipalities and university. The BJP in-charge of Tripura Sunil Deodhar who played the key role in victory of the party, said, “Maharaja Bir Bikram was a vikas purush, an extraordinary man. He did so much for Tripura but has never received that kind of attention. We are trying to get him the Bharat Ratna. We are also trying to ensure that the Agartala airport is named after him.’’ The BJP strategists laid focus on non-development of the frontier state where unemployment and non-compliance of pay commission’s recommendation for state government employees became a major issue. In fact of the three states, Tripura was also the most keenly watched for being the last Left bastion in the country. The 69-year-old outgoing chief minister Manik Sarkar, has governed Tripura since 1998. A politburo member of CPI(M), he had been at the helm for the fourth consecutive time. Besides tapping into the youth, the BJP made aggressive best efforts to break the CPI(M)’s stranglehold in 20 seats reserved for tribals, which possibly turned the ride in its favour. The BJP led alliance has succeeded in winning all the 20 tribal reserved seats. The IPFT general secretary Mewat Jamatia has won from the Asharambari seat with a massive margin of 7,000 votes. It is significant that BJP had contested 50 seats in the last assembly polls in 2013 and its candidates forfeited their deposits on 49 seats. However, with just 1.87 per cent of votes, it failed to win any seat in the state. The CPI(M) had won 49 of the 55 seats it contested while the Congress managed to win 10 out of 48 seats it contested. Though, CPM was voted out of power, it succeeded in retaining 43 per cent vote share whereas BJP made significant jump in vote bank by securing 42.8 per cent votes from its dismal performance of 2013 in which it has got 1.5 per cent of votes. The BJP got the lead with vote share of its alliance partner IPFT, which polled 7.7 per cent votes The Left, after voted out of power in a statement, “The BJP has, apart from other factors, utilised massive deployment of money and other resources to influence the elections. The BJP was able to consolidate all the anti-Left votes, virtually appropriating the erstwhile main opposition party, the Congress.” The party’s polit bureau also thanked the 45 per cent people that supported the Left Front, and said it would take remedial measures after carefully examining the reasons for its loss."

KCR’s Modi remark slip of tongue: K T Rama Rao,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST IT minister K.T. Rama Rao had to cobble together an excuse for his father and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s implied criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has created a storm in a teacup in BJP ranks.  He told a highly indignant defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday that it was a ‘slip of the tongue’ by the CM who should not have put it quite like that. During a meeting in Karimnagar on February 26, the Chief Minister had not minced his words when criticising Mr Modi and referred to him as “that Prime Minister Modi gaadu” (fellow). State BJP leaders took umbrage at this and complained to Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan that such a term was “unsavoury” and “unparliamentary.” They even sent reports to central BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister himself, with a translation of the CM’s comments. The defence minister, who was in the city on Thursday evening, told the press that she had almost decided not to come when she came to know “about the comments made by one constitutional authority like Chief Minister against another constitutional authority like Prime Minister.”  Ms Sitharaman said that despite having ideological differences, one should not address the Prime Minister in such a manner. She said even if it is a slip of the tongue, the Chief Minister should have given an explanation. “I was invited to Hyderabad to attend a defence-related programme on Thursday. On Wednesday, I called IT minister K.T. Rama Rao who was in Nalgonda on tour and raised objection over the comments. I told him I am unable to understand whether I should come or not. It wouldn’t look good if I participate in the programme after the Prime Minister was belittled by the CM. “I came today and attended the function along with the minister and again I spoke to him about this. Then K.T. Rama Rao garu told me ‘it was just a slip of the tongue, my father will not speak in that way’. I participated because Make in India from Telangana will have a huge impact on the aerospace industry.” “We can give responses to ideological criticism if they have been said in appropriate manner,” she said.  “It is sad that a CM spoke like this. We felt very sad and even the co-untry should feel sad,” Ms Sitharaman said."

He said the TD and YSR Congress should both move the motion so that the Modi government will talk terms with Andhra Pradesh’s MPs.  The idea was picked up by Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy who said that his party MPs will move a no-confidence motion and it is for Pawan Kalyan to enlist support for the motion including from the ruling TDP. Given the one-upmanship presently being displayed by the rival TDP and YSRCP, it is doubtful that they can unite in moving the no-trust motion in Parliament. On Monday, TD Chief and AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did mention the No Confidence Motion on two occasions. He first said that it would be of no use and later corrected his statement and said a no-trust move should be the last opportunity after exploring all other options. The fact of the matter is that unless the TD breaks  its alliance with the BJP-led NDA government at the centre first, it cannot move a no-trust motion. However, Pawan Kalyan on Monday evening again said it is his responsibility to muster support for the move and he will go to Delhi and talk to all other opposition parties in the Lok Sabha to garner support."

"Manik Sarkar can take shelter in WB, Kerala or B'desh: BJP's Himanta Biswa",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Outgoing Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar can take shelter in West Bengal, Kerala or neighbouring Bangladesh as the BJP is going to form the next government in the state, Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday. “Manik Sarkar has just three options before him. He can go to West Bengal, where the CPI-M still has some presence. He can go to Kerala, where the party is in power and will rule for three more years or he can go to neighbouring Bangladesh,” Sarma told reporters in Agartala when asked about his comments on Sarkar during an election rally.  The BJP leader had kicked up a row by reportedly saying that the Tripura chief minister would be sent to Bangladesh after the assembly elections in the state. Sarma reportedly made the remark at an election rally in Dhanpur, Sarkar’s constituency, while criticising the state government over the alleged deteriorating law and order situation and cross-border crimes. The 69-year-old chief minister has governed Tripura since 1998. He is a politburo member of CPI-M and has been ruling the state for the fourth consecutive time. Elections in 59 seats, out of the 60-member Tripura assembly, were held on February 18. Election in one seat was countermanded due to the death of the CPI-M candidate. The BJP and its ally Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) were leading in 41 out of the 59 constituencies whose trends were available, according to Election Commission sources in Agartala on Saturday."

"Movements, agitations strengthen democracy",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST As Anna Hazare’s fast entered its fourth day (at the time of writing this article), the dwindling crowd of not more than 1,500-2,000 at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan was a pale reflection of the previous “anti-corruption” movement he had led in 2011. This time, his demands aren’t just implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013, but also includes farmers’ distress and electoral reforms.  Going by newspaper reports, he is already showing signs of relenting when Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan paid him a visit and showed him a video of Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s speech saying the Centre was making efforts to end the agrarian crisis. Anna reportedly seemed convinced, only demanding that the Centre give its assurance in writing. The reports did not say anything either about appointing a Lokpal or about the use of ballot papers as Mr Hazare had demanded. It’s a far cry from 2011 when even after several rounds of meetings with senior UPA Cabinet ministers Anna was not easily convinced that for enacting legislation, the opinion of legitimately-elected representatives of the people through an electoral process could not be ignored and sacrificed at the altar of “popular” demands as advocated by him and his former colleagues pushing for acceptance of their version of the Jan Lokpal Bill. But perhaps the most significant fallout of the 2011 movement was not the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, but the emergence of a new political party from a self-proclaimed non-political movement, and the subsequent absorption of many of the faces of the movement into the current ruling party, the BJP. Some of the leaders of the movement who made fun of politicians and political parties went on to become state chief ministers, Central ministers or in one case a lieutenant-governor appointed by the current government. In order to ensure that his protest was not used as a platform to launch political careers, Anna had asked the participants in the current protest to sign affidavits stating that they would not join political parties or contest elections. At the same Ramlila Maidan where Anna is holding his agitation now, a highly revered personality of his time, Jayaprakash Narayan, gave a thunderous call for “Total Revolution” in 1975, asking the police and the military to disobey the government led by Mrs Indira Gandhi. What followed is too well known to bear repetition here. Though JP was beyond any party politics by then, his political experience, suaveness and revered personality kept him at the centre of the anti-Indira agitation. In 1977, when the Emergency was withdrawn and elections declared, the Janata Dal was formed under his guidance and went on to defeat the Congress and to form the first non-Congress government at the Centre. The current crop of Bihar leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar were all associated as student leaders in JP’s movement.  Unlike JP, Anna was not political, and perhaps unwittingly allowed his platform to be used for the furthering of political ambitions by people who led the movement. There is no doubt that he benefited from the leadership and organisational skills of Arvind Kejriwal and others who turned the agitation into a massive public spectacle attended and supported by celebrities, the general public and reportedly by the RSS as well. The “India Against Corruption” agitation in 2011 found huge support from the urban middle class, who had increasingly wanted to have a share of the political pie, and was making its presence felt through the politics of activism. The educated urban population could find resonance with the anti-corruption cause; and their desire to have a voice in contemporary politics reflected in the massive electoral success of newly-formed Aam Aadmi Party in 2013, followed by even a greater victory in the 2015 Delhi Assembly polls. But Mr Kejriwal’s subsequent defeats in elections held outside Delhi showed that rants of anti-corruption and mere rhetoric of “alternative politics” are perhaps not sufficient to win elections. Agitational politics had always been a legitimate way to protest against government policies or their absence. The past year saw thousands of farmers and farm labourers agitate across India protesting against the Narendra Modi government’s indifference to farmers’ plight. Faced with increasing production costs, droughts and falling incomes, the farmers are demanding debt relief, better prices and effective insurance schemes against crop failures. Though Anna’s taking up farmers’ causes did not have much impact in Delhi, various peasant organisations across the country are continuing with their protests against the insensitive Central government. People’s movements are nothing new in India. Besides numerous political agitations, there have been social movements centered on various causes that attracted public participation in large numbers, forcing governments to change, amend and retract decisions in favour of the movement.  In the 1970s, a proposed hydroelectric project that would have destroyed a large area of pristine forest in the now famous Silent Valley in Kerala’s Palakkad district was shelved after an effective and sustained people’s movement and protests by local NGOs. The Chipko movement was another popular movement to save trees, again in the 1970s, led by Sunderlal Bahuguna. Women were major participants and the driving force in the movement, educating people about the perilous effects of deforestation. The horrific Nirbhaya rape in New Delhi in December 2012, that shook the collective conscience of the nation and brought issues like violence and crimes against women into the forefront of public discourse, had led to huge and spontaneous protests by students, activists and ordinary citizens. As a result of such mass protests, the government set up the Justice Verma Committee and as per its recommendations amended the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013. The politics of activism, the involvement of civil society and the participation of citizens in movements influencing, or attempting to influence, government policies are healthy elements of democracy. Through agitation or peaceful demonstrations, planned or spontaneous movements; the participation of pressure groups, concerned citizens, social activists and NGOs through the politics of confrontation and consultation can only make our democratic institutions stronger and more vibrant."

"Himanta Biswa Sarma is BJP’s man in Northeast, again",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST The man with the gloating rights today for solidly establishing the BJP in Northeast politics is party strategist Himanta Biswa Sarma. A former Congress man, Sarma has already delivered Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh to the party’s kitty, and continues to work towards what he calls ""mainstreaming the northeast region"" in the country’s politics.   He told a news channel before counting on Saturday, “If we win Tripura and regain Nagaland, have a government in Meghalaya, our expansion in Northeast is complete.” The only other state Mizoram, is ruled by the Congress and goes to polls later this year. Results for the three states now show that the BJP has won Tripura – ending Left Front chief minister Manik Sarkar’s two-decade rule – won Nagaland with partner NDPP and can swing a coalition in Meghalaya where the ruling Congress doesn’t look it will get a majority. He said: “In Meghalaya, we have to talk among parties and install non-Congress government."" Sarma joined the BJP in 2015, and swung a massive victory in Assam for the party. In 2017, he effected a BJP government in Manipur, thought the BJP did not win a majority in the state. In Arunachal Pradesh, he broke the Congress, spirited away 40 rebel MLAs to form a party at the Assembly that is supported by the BJP. Sarma told , “I am in the BJP for this. The enormous attention Prime Minister Narendra Modi and (BJP president) Amit Shah are paying the Northeast is extraordinary,"" he said. “In my entire political life, I have never seen a national political party pay so much attention to the northeast. It is about winning the hearts of the people of the northeast. People are very happy about this.”"

Modi needs to change the hawkish doctrine,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST States have an image of themselves that inspires their policies in the global order. A basic principle that governs their foreign policy emerges. For centuries, Britain adhered to the principle of balance of power in Europe. It required the country to ensure that no power emerged to pose a threat to Britain’s security. The United States announced its Monroe Doctrine to keep European powers out of Latin America, which ensured US hegemony in that region. Russia and later the Soviet Union were anxious about external influences in the Eastern European countries. Similarly, India developed a doctrine by 1946 because the Congress spokesman on foreign affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru, had set notions about the country’s role in Asia, especially in South Asia, and in the world at large. On independence he became India’s Prime Minister as well as its foreign minister. He sought for India a clear ascendancy over its neighbours and aspired for it a role in world affairs — eventually the status of a great power. To this day, neither he nor any of his successors realised that that aspiration itself required stable, friendly relationships with its neighbours. The BJP’s first Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, was no chauvinist. But the present BJP government headed by Mr Narendra Modi is very much so. He and his national security adviser (NSA), Ajit Doval, are determined to wipe out the Nehruvian approach in all fields. Modi, an RSS activist, had no grounding in foreign affairs. This did not deter him from declaring that China is expansionist some years ago. His speeches on Pakistan as chief minister of Gujarat were laced with communal jibes (“Mian Musharraf”). He had to perforce rely on an “expert” who shared his worldview. He had not far to look to find one. It was a former director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) Ajit Doval. In article after article in the press he revealed himself as a card-carrying hawk. A former head of RAW, A.S. Dulat, called him “the hawkish Ajit Doval”.  Modi appointed him as NSA almost immediately after he became Prime Minister in May 2014. Upon assuming office, Doval began systematically imposing his footprints on the course India has since followed in its external relations. This is particularly true in India’s relations with Pakistan. The articles he wrote in the decade between his retirement as director IB in 2005 and assumption of office as NSA in 2014 reveal his mindset.  Doval’s communal outlook is reflected in his description of Kashmiri Pandits as its “civilisational inheritors”. During a lecture in Hyderabad in 2010, Doval called Pakistan a “failing and degraded state”. From this followed prescriptions, which he announced in speech after speech. In February 2014, at the Shastra University, he asked: “So, how to tackle Pakistan?” He urged India to shed its “defensive mode” because “Pakistan’s vulnerabilities are many times higher than us [sic]. Once they know that India has shifted its gear from defensive mode to defensive-offence, they will find that it is unaffordable for them. You may do one Mumbai, you may lose Balochistan.” The emphasis was Eisenhower’s secretary of state John Foster Dulles’ policy of “massive retaliation”. Doval explained, “Similar disproportionate responses should be given at the Line of Control for firing and make them feel the pain; set red lines for talks, which when crossed would be grounds for calling off talks, and stick with it.” This explains why the talks were repeatedly called off, “the surgical strike” along the LoC and the present impasse in the dialogue between India and Pakistan. Modi follows the Doval line. In his speech at the Red Fort on August 15 2016, he spoke of Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. This policy has failed."

"Believe Congress was firm's client, says Cambridge Analytica whistleblower",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Christopher Wylie, former Cambridge Analytica employee and the whistleblower behind the Facebook privacy scandal, told British that his company worked extensively in India and he believed the Congress was the company’s client at the regional level. ""I believe their client was Congress but I know that they have done all kinds of project. I don't remember a national project but I know regionally. India's so big that one state can be as big as Britain,"" Wylie was seen saying while deposing before the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in London.  He also said that Cambridge Analytica has offices in India and employed staff. Soon after the testimony details came out, the ruling BJP sought apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “Today the whistleblower Christopher Wylie has confirmed that Cambridge Analytica worked with Congress. This has exposed Rahul Gandhi who was denying all along. Congress and Rahul Gandhi must now apologize,” Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Christopher Wylie came into the limelight last week after he alleged that information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. He further alleged that the data was used to help politicians, including US President Donald Trump during 2016 presidential polls and the Brexit campaign. Last week, BJP questioned links between the Congress and the data analysis firm. The Congress denied any links with the disgraced firm and said that BJP and JD(U) used its services in 2010."

BJP survey: Congress leads in 100 seats in Karnataka,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST With less than six weeks to go before Karnataka goes to the polls, and the BJP's internal surveys clearly indicating that the Congress party in the state has the edge in over a 100 constituencies in the 224 seat Assembly, the BJP's spin doctors are strongly leaning towards an aggressive campaign that steps up the Hindutva quotient in the communally sensitive coastal districts while simultaneously pushing  'Brand Modi.' Ground reports reaching the national headquarters here indicate that the party's move to project the ""tainted"" B.S. Yeddyurappa as their chief ministerial candidate has ""not gone down well"" with the electorate, and rather than having the former chief minister as the face of the BJP campaign, the party will organise more rallies by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  With the Congress playing its own Hindutva card which has seen the party chief, Mr Rahul Gandhi, continuing with his temple run on his visit to the state on Saturday, offering prayers at the iconic Chamundi Hills shrine in Mysuru, following on from Congress Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's move to break the BJP's hold over its Lingayat community votebank, the BJP is rushing party president Amit Shah to reach out to the religious leaders who head the Lingayat 'mathas' or religious institutions, and influence the vote. Ahead of the state assembly elections, CM Siddarmaiah had last Monday accepted the recommendations of the Nagamohan Das committee to award  separate religion status for the Lingayats community. Together with the survey that shows the Congress is ""marginally ahead,"" in roughly half the seats, the move has rattled the BJP. In Karnataka,  Lingayats are estimated to be around 17 percent of the population, and Vokkaligas about 14 per cent. The upper caste communities traditionally vote for the BJP and the Janata Dal (S) respectively. Siddaramaiah's own Kuruba community which comprises nine percent of the state's population is part of the Congress' vote bank as are the Muslims, who constitute 11 percent of the state's population alongside Dalits and OBCs. The BJP, which is apparently aware that Karnataka could be its only hope in the South, following its lack of presence in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, has decided to go all out to win Karnataka, and plans to unleash the Modi-Shah juggernaut in the state closer to the poll announcement dates. The Hindutva face of the BJP in the coastal districts and MP, Mr Ananth Kumar Hegde, is already mobilising the masses in his Uttara Kannada constituency, part of the communally sensitive coastal belt of Karnataka. ""We need to push the Hindutva factor to cut through the caste equation,"" a senior BJP functionary said."

Defeat before a ‘cash-rich BJP’,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Senior Congress leaders like Oommen Chandy, K. V. Thomas, K. C. Joseph and Laly Vincent who had campaigned extensively for the Congress in Meghalaya feel their party did put up a formidable fight but was no match for the “money power” unleashed by the BJP. When Mr Joseph accompanied Mr Chandy during the first round, the local leaders told them that BJP would not win more than four seats. “It’s unbelievable that Union culture ministry was flooding the state with money under the guise of church renovation as 40 percent of the population are Catholics and the rest Baptists,” the Irikkur legislator told DC. “Majority of the churches refused their help. As of now, Congress does have a chance of forming the government with the support of independents. Things are not going to be easy in Kerala too with the way the BJP is hurling money.”  Mr Thomas who has close ties with the Catholic church knew several priests including the bishops personally. He feels that the Congress should take a leaf out of the book of the BJP planning much in advance.  Kerala leaders who campaigned also included Anto Antony MP and Joseph Vazhakkan. They were there for less than a week to 10 days which was not adequate. “It's high time the Congress got rid of groups in the state and took the initiative to strengthen the booth committees and should have a party worker for ten voters in each”, said the Ernakulam lawmaker. But Mr Chandy feels there is nothing to be panic in the way in which the saffron party now stands to control 21 of the 29 states.  “People of Kerala should be vigilant against the threats the BJP pose. We have to somehow jump the hurdle of BJP’s money power through determination and collective work,” he told DC. Ms Vincent who was there for close to two weeks has got a few points to strengthen the Congress party in Kerala. “CPI should be brought to UDF. At the same time, KC (M) chairman K. M. Mani should also be brought to the front. Otherwise, it is going to be tough to tackle the cash-rich BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections,” the KPCC vice-president said."

"TRS, Congress to woo Telugu Desam for tie-up",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST The Telugu Desam has become the most sought-after alliance partner in Telangana for the 2019 elections after it snapped ties with the BJP. Both the ruling TRS and the main opposition party, the Congress, are keen to have a pre-poll tie-up with the TD. These parties feel that the TD still enjoys up to seven per cent of the traditional vote bank in Telangana State and this will play a decisive role on who will capture the power in the state in 2019.  While the Congress is learnt to be ready to offer a Lok Sabha seat and 15 Assembly seats to the TD in 2019, the TRS is reportedly in favour of offering  a Lok Sabha and 12 Assembly seats. Even after bifurcation of state and the TD being projected as a “Andhra party” during the 2014 elections, it won one Lok Sabha and 15 Assembly seats in TS in alliance with the BJP. However, the TD’s lone Lok Sabha member from Malkajgiri Ch. Malla Reddy and 12 MLAs defe-cted to the TRS, while TD MLA Revanth Reddy defected to the Congress. With the defection, the Telugu Desam is now left with only two MLAs, Sandra Venkata Veeraiah (Sathupally) and R. Krishnaiah (LB Nagar). The TD’s alliance partner BJP won one Lok Sabha seat from Secunde-rabad (Bandaru Dattat-reya) and five MLA seats, all from GHMC limits (Amberpet, Musheera-bad, Uppal, Khairatabad and Goshamal). With the TD moving away from the BJP in protest against the NDA government’s refusal to accord special category status to AP recently, the impact is being felt on Telangana too. TD national president and AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has kept the alliance options in Telangana ‘open’ and during the meeting held with Telangana TD leaders in Hyderabad last month. In fact, T-TD leader Mothkupalli Narsimhulu has already proposed either the merge T-TD in the TRS or striking a pre-poll alliance, which created flutter in party circles. MLA A.Revanth Reddy has been pitching for Congress-TDP alliance. Congress sources said, “The proposal of Congress-TD alliance has already been discussed with Congress president Rahul Gandhi. It is under his active consideration.”"

"Knee-jerk reaction: Hit back by BJP on data breach, Cong pulls down app, site",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Hours after being accused by the ruling BJP of sharing user data, Congress on Monday took down both its App and the party membership website. The Congress app is no longer available on Google Playstore. Those clicking on to its membership site are greeted by with the message reading: ""We are incorporating minor changes to the website. Please visit us again in a while to access the INC Membership process.""  In-charge of BJP's national Information and Technology, Amit Malviya was among the first to react to the Congress pulling down its App. Rahul Gandhi gave a call to , but Congress deleted its own App from the App store after they were called out. What is the Congress party hiding? Malviya further added, ""All of you who complained about the surge in anti-BJP and anti-government messages and fake news in recent days on social media, now know who was behind it - an insidious Cambridge Analytica hired by a desperate Congress!"" In earlier tweets on Monday, the BJP IT head had raised ""privacy and consent conflicts"" in the Congress party's own App. Hi! My name is Rahul Gandhi. I am the President of India’s oldest political party. When you sign up for our official App, I give all your data to my friends in Singapore. The Congress has been targeting the BJP over the Narendra Modi app of the Prime Minister amid reports that it sent user data to a US-based company without consent. The allegation surfaced alongside a massive scandal over the alleged misuse of personal data of Facebook users by the disgraced research group Cambridge Analytica to help political parties. On Monday morning too, Congress President Rahul Gandhi continued his attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP with another Tweet, posted with the hashtag #DeleteNaMoApp. Modi’s NaMo App secretly records audio, video, contacts of your friends & family and even tracks your location via GPS.  He’s the Big Boss who likes to spy on Indians.  Now he wants data on our children. 13 lakh NCC cadets are being forced to download the APP. The Congress President further accused Narendra Modi of misusing the Prime Ministerial post to build personal database with intel on millions of Indians via the NaMo App promoted by the government. Modi misusing PM position to build personal database with data on millions of Indians via the NaMo App promoted by Govt.  If as PM he wants to use tech to communicate with India, no problem. But use the official PMO APP for it.  This data belongs to India, not Modi. "

"Tripura’s win is people’s answer to fear, lies, confusion spread against BJP: Modi",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called the BJP's impressive performance in Tripura Assembly polls people's answer to ""fear, lies and confusion"" being spread against his government, and targeted the Congress, saying it was never so diminished as a party as it is now. Addressing party workers at the BJP's newly constructed headquarters following the announcement of results of polls in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, the Prime Minister also took an apparent dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying some people grow in designation but shrink in stature. In contrast, he said, BJP chief Amit Shah rose by leading the party to victories in many states.  In remarks laced with sarcasm, Narendra Modi said he had recently told Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy that the Congress leader was lucky as he will soon become a ""specimen of a Congress chief minister"" as his party will be in power only in his state by June after losing Karnataka, which goes to the polls in April-May. Referring to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who heads the Congress government in the state, he said neither he nor they (Congress) consider each other their own. ""He is a 'swatantra fauji' (independent soldier),"" Narendra Modi said of Amarinder Singh. The Prime Minister said people of northeast had a sense of alienation but his government worked overtime to remove it. Central ministers have spent more nights in one of these states to deal with their problems in the last four years than they did all the years earlier, he said. ""Fear, lies and confusion were being spread,"" he said, an apparent reference to the opposition's criticism of his government over a host of issues, and now people have answered it through their votes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a brief pause when there was a call for prayers from a nearby mosque, and also paid respects along with the audience to deceased party workers, allegedly victims of political violence, by keeping silence for a while. He was felicitated by senior party functionaries, including members of the BJP parliamentary board, headed by Amit Shah."

"West Bengal CM slams Amit Shah, blames CPI(M), Cong for BJP's win in Tripura",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST Discounting BJP's massive success in the Assembly Elections in Tripura West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of winning the neighbouring state with the help of outsiders, money power and the central para-military forces. Hitting out at BJP President Amit Shah for his next targets of winning three more states — West Bengal, Odhisa and Karnataka the Trinamool Congress supremo wondered if the BJP would be able to continue at the Centre after the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.  Mamata Banerjee, who recently said she would be happy if the CPI(M) would win the Assembly Elections in Tripura, revealed that she gave an offer to Congress President Rahul Gandhi of an alliance and seat-sharing which was rejected. Blaming the Congress and the CPI(M) she observed that it was not the BJP's victory in Tripura. The CPI(M)'s arrogance and the Congress' failure were the results of the assembly polls, she noted adding that had the Congress not turned down her proposal for an alliance, the results may have been otherwise. Hinting at foul play she alleged that something unnatural has happened in the Tripura polls which has made its results a ‘mystery’. “I do not see any reason for the BJP to be emphatic over its victory in the Assembly polls in Tripura. The CPI(M) bagged 45 per cent of the total votes. It is no less. And the BJP got 50 per cent votes. What you are not saying is that in the North Eastern states power is grabbed with the help of source and force whoever stays in power at the Centre. I have only one objection which I spoke about in the Assembly recently,” she said at state secretariat Nabanna on Saturday evening. Mamata Banerjee alleged, “They (BJP) spent huge amount of money. Many incidents took place over EVMs. They brought outsiders to Tripura apart from misusing the central forces there. But I need to know why the CPI(M) did not protest. The CPI(M) totally surrendered itself to the BJP. Had they not surrendered, the results would not have been bad. There was a difference of only five cent votes. While the Congress suffered failures, the CPI(M) surrendered.” The Trinamool chief claimed, “If you ask about the Congress' failures, I would say that I bought a change in 1987 in Tripura. It is not that change did not take place ever there. It is wrong which is being circulated in the social network. After the change in 1987 in Tripura the atmosphere was set for another change in 1992 when Prime Minister Narsimha Rao imposed the President's Rule at the behest of the CPI(M). Had it not been so, the Congress would have come to power then again.” She added, “So there are instances in the history. Incumbency creeped in as the Left Front has been in the politics for a long time. Had the Congress given a tough fight, the difference bagging of four-five votes would not have been a big matter. In that case the BJP would have got only ten seats. Today I disclose that I made a request to the Congress. I personally told Rahul Gandhi: Look we are new in Tripura and we are yet to do anything there. I urged him to take part in the fight jointly Congress and Trinamul alongwith the hill-based parties.” The West Bengal chief minister reasoned, “But they did not do it. I even suggested them for a seat adjustment which covered 14 seats to be contested by us and 16 others to be contested by the hill-based parties while the Congress would contest in 30 seats. This would have led to the creation of a platform. Had the platform been created, the difference in vote percentage would not have happened. But the Congress did nothing. I do not know why the Congress supplied oxygen to the BJP.” She mentioned, “I am saying all these now because I gave it a thought and I pursued it also. I do not know at whose advice they did not accept my proposal. As a result the Congress vote percentage now stands at around two per cent. It is shame for them because they were the opposition party there.”"

"Oppn parties have begun impeachment process against CJI, says NCP leader",deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST NCP leader DP Tripathi on Tuesday said that opposition parties, including the Congress, have initiated the process to impeach Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. ""A lot of opposition parties have signed the draft proposal for moving an impeachment motion against CJI Dipak Misra. Many parties like Congress Party, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Left parties and I think TMC have also signed it,"" said NCP General Secretary DP Tripathi.  The development follows West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's meeting with senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan earlier in the day to discuss a possible impeachment motion against the CJI. The impeachment motion is in relation to the CJI's handling of the matters raised by four Supreme Court judges in a press conference on January 11. Justices Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, MB Lokur and Kurien Joseph had earlier this year said Misra was assigning important cases in an arbitrary manner to junior judges, ignoring these four senior judges."

Siddaramaiah trying to divide Hindus with Lingayat card: Amit Shah,deccan," Wednesday, Mar 28, 2018 | Last Update : 09:30 AM IST With Karnataka elections round the corner, BJP President Amit Shah once again attacked Karnataka Chief Minister and Congress leader Siddaramaiah for recommending special status to Lingayat community. The BJP President said, ""Rahul Gandhi says that Congress unites Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians. He should look at how Siddaramaiah is trying to divide even Hindus.""  ""'Lingayat card' played by Congress is not aimed at benefiting the community but to stop BS Yeddyurappa from becoming the chief minister. People of Karnataka will reject this through ballot,"" the BJP president said. Intensifying his attack on Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka, Amit Shah said, ""The politics of appeasement in Karnataka is dangerous for the society."" Talking to the media in Bengaluru, Shah said that farmer suicides have increased in the states where Congress is in power while it has decreased in states governed by his party. The cases of farmers suicide reported in the states ruled by BJP were the results of ""depression and personal issues"", Shah said. ""There has been BJP govt in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the last 15 years and farmer suicide numbers in these states have been very low,"" Amit Shah said. The BJP President said that Karnataka government under BJP will also be farmer-friendly. Citing the case of Maharashtra, Amit Shah said the state's BJP government was a ""farmer friendly"" government. ""Farmer suicides have reduced after BJP came to power in the state,"" he said. ""I am certain that the sincerity that PM Narendra Modi has for the betterment of farmers cannot be matched by others. Some of the farmer-friendly schemes launched by PM Modi have been crucial for ensuring a better future for farmers,"" Shah said. Amit Shah exuded confidence that the BJP will form government in Karnataka with an absolute majority under the leadership of BS Yeddyurappa."

Andhra Let Down Not By Centre But Chandrababu Naidu,ndtv," Sections 337 Time hasn't healed the wound that the UPA-led bifurcation of united Andhra Pradesh left in Indian democracy. The promises contained in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, and those left outside its purview, still pave the course for national politics. When the Bill was proposed, leaders from 18 national parties realised that the bifurcation would leave the successor Andhra Pradesh largely an agrarian state with dismal financial accounts. They appropriately demanded special measures to ensure that the state's development be at par with other states. On February 20, 2014, amidst chaotic sloganeering in the Rajya Sabha, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the country that the successor state of Andhra Pradesh will be granted Special Category Status for a period of five years. In the following month, the union cabinet the Planning Commission, then the pertinent body, to implement the assurance. Despite these facts, why have claims recently emerged that Andhra Pradesh cannot be accorded the Special Category Status? The reflexive response seems to be that the Fourteenth Finance Commission's recommendations disallow the government from according any state with Special Category status. This claim is hogwash and so easily disproved that it's ludicrous that newspapers have been parroting it without a factual disclaimer. Firstly, the Fourteenth Finance Commission made no such recommendation. It only proposed that no distinction be made between Special Category and other states for the purposes of the centre's devolution of taxes to States and revenue deficit grants; it did not recommend doing away with the Special Category Status itself. Several members of the Fourteenth Finance Commission to correct the disinformation, and have added that the other benefits that come with the Special Category Status, including greater assistance for central schemes and relaxed norms for externally-aided projects, still apply. In the words of M Govinda Rao, a member of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, the Commission had ""no business to make any recommendations on the [Special Category Status] issue."" Secondly, the Commission's report was placed before parliament almost a year after the aforementioned cabinet direction to the Planning Commission. The recommendations are not retrospective in nature; even if they contained such a recommendation, they would have no effect on Andhra Pradesh's legal right to the Special Category Status. Now, union ministers belonging to the Telegu Desam Party (TDP) have resigned over the issue at the behest of their party leader Chandrababu Naidu and the TDP has pulled out of NDA. In their press conference, the former ministers said circumstances necessitated the move as the Special Category Status has become a ""sentimental"" and ""emotional"" issue for the people of Andhra Pradesh. Could something be more disrespectful than reducing a people's struggle for their legal rights to a mere emotive display? The statements have only betrayed TDP's stunted understanding of democratic agitation, law and policy. The fact is that in 2015, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu himself traded away the promised Special Category Status for a ""special package"", which, he has now realized, is wholly inadequate to compensate for Andhra Pradesh's woes. The complete u-turn in his stand, which is easily confirmed by consulting news reports from 2015 through 2017, might be shocking to some but is easily explained. By asking TDP members to exit the Modi Cabinet, Naidu now seeks to shift his odious record in development and governance - particularly the in the building of the new capital in Amaravati and the in the Polavaram irrigation project - to the central government. It should be amply clear that Andhra Pradesh is legally entitled to the Special Category Status. After the dissolution of the Planning Commission, the relevant responsibilities of allocating funds to states have fallen to the Finance Ministry. Since the government is a continuous body, the legal sanctity of the March 2014 cabinet decision still stands. Perhaps in the fight for the Special Category Status, the people of Andhra Pradesh, including me, have sent the wrong message to the public by using the word ""grant"" where we should have used the word ""implement"" instead. Clearly, the implementation of the Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh just awaits political will. And as the nation will soon see, there is no lack of it in Andhra Pradesh. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."

Amit Shah Strikes At Heart Of Akhilesh-Mayawati Deal,ndtv," Sections 27 This round of elections to the Rajya Sabha has come as a big boon for the ruling BJP, as it is for the first time in history that the party has emerged as the single-largest group in the Upper House. On two earlier occasions when the Congress was in the opposition in 1977 and 1998, the party enjoyed the privilege of controlling the Rajya Sabha and being the largest in the house. This position has slipped away from the Congress this time with the party losing many seats and the BJP making big gains. The biggest gains for the BJP as expected are from Uttar Pradesh. The party not only got eight seats but it succeeded in snatching the additional ninth seat, stopping a gain for Mayawati with the Samajwadi Party's help. This became possible because of internal dissensions among the new partners who famously stopped the BJP in the recent by-elections to Lok Sabha from the state. The Rajya Sabha poll tie-up between the SP and the BSP was the second experiment in stopping the BJP on its tracks. The significance of this round of Rajya Sabha polls is that the NDA has emerged in a commanding position, though on its own it is still short by 40 seats for a majority in the 245-member house. The BJP has emerged as the largest single party and the NDA the largest bloc, but it is not yet near the majority. The Congress' strength has fallen to 52. The BJP has gained because of cross-voting in Uttar Pradesh from Mayawati's party. Actually it was expected that the last-minute defection by Naresh Agarwal would damage the SP, but the real loser is the BSP.  Mayawati had made it a condition that a Rajya Sabha seat for her party would cement the anti-BJP alliance in the state. She was to announce her next move after the Rajya Sabha poll. She may not have fathomed the defection from her own party. Clearly, the BJP had done its homework better. It goes to the credit of the meticulous strategy of BJP chief Amit Shah that not only did he ensure BJP victories in so many states but he managed to snatch at least three extra seats for the party (UP, Jharkhand and Karnataka). The gains the BJP and NDA have made in the Rajya Sabha are crucial for the ruling party's governance agenda. So far, the Opposition has enjoyed the veto in the Upper House. It was able to block many bills, pass resolutions criticizing the government, and the numerical advantage it enjoyed stopped many pet programmes of the Modi government. That is no longer the situation. With friendly parties in the opposition, now the NDA will be in a position to call the shots even in the Rajya Sabha. With 22 states under its rule, it is natural that the BJP was bound to gain number of seats. In the coming days, this trend is likely to strengthen the BJP and thin the opposition. The BSP leader Mayawati was so confident of winning one seat that she made all arrangements to ensure that her candidate got 37 first preference votes. She had asked the SP to give a list of ten loyal MLAs from the SP who were to vote for her candidate. She was assured of seven Congress votes and one from Ajit Singh's party.  The counting of votes in UP was disrupted because of allegations of cross-voting from both SP and BSP. The net gainer is the BJP. With cross-voting from her own party damaging BSP candidate's prospects, Mayawati cannot charge Akhilesh with betrayal. But it is a major setback for the SP-BSP joint effort which succeeded in stopping the BJP in the recent Lok Sabha bypoll from Gorakhpur and Phulpur in UP. The UP debacle will strain the deal between the SP and BSP at least temporarily. Including one bypoll, there were 59 Rajya Sabha seats involved in Friday's poll. Of this, 33 seats were declared unopposed and the rest 25 seats were declared after a contest. Normally, Rajya Sabha polls are not considered a barometer for political temperature as MLAs vote on predicted lines. Only cross-voting make headlines. This time, the importance lies in the BJP, which has an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha but was so far kept under check by the Congress, building its numerical superiority in the Rajya Sabha. The BJP has also demonstrated its manipulative skills when it comes to cornering its arch-rivals. Now the party can breathe easy in the Upper House too. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018.

"BJP's Karnataka Hope BS Yeddyurappa Is 75; Party Says Age Bar ""Unofficial""",ndtv," Sections | Written by | 458 On Tuesday, as former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa turned 75, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a rally in Karnataka in a symbolic boost to the state BJP chief's election campaign in the southern state. The BJP has also projected Mr Yeddyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate in Congress-ruled Karnataka. But there could be a catch -- the BJP is said to have a cut-off of 75 years for anyone who wants to contest elections, though party president Amit Shah has denied any such age limit. ""It is not a mandatory policy in the BJP constitution. It is only unofficial guidelines followed by the party. There have been exceptions in the past as well,"" BJP spokesperson S Prakash told NDTV. Senior BJP leaders said Mr Yeddyurappa was not 75 when he was chosen as the chief ministerial candidate and as someone who would lead the party in the Karnataka assembly election. Mr Yeddyurappa's party has said he also is the only sitting Member of Parliament who has been allowed to contest the Karnataka assembly election. If the party does come to power in Karnataka, he would, however, need to be a legislator to be the chief minister. The Congress has now taken hold of the issue to attack the BJP in a bid to create confusion in the rival party as part of its election offensive. Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao said the BJP ""is just using him (Mr Yeddyurappa) because they have nobody else in Karnataka."" ""This is an internal matter of the BJP. But knowing our Prime Minister, the reason why he came yesterday (to Karnataka) was to say goodbye to Yeddyurappa... I think after the elections, whatever happens, this would be the final function Yeddyurappa is having,"" Mr Rao told NDTV. The Election Commission has said the dates for the Karnataka assembly election would be announced around April 15.  © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."

Yogi's Touching Concern For Mayawati Betrays Anxiety,ndtv," Sections 35 Amit Shah, chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won his grudge match ably assisted by Piyush Goyal, union minister who he stationed in Lucknow against ""Bua"" and ""Bhatija"" (BSP chief, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, chief of the SP) by snatching a Rajya Sabha seat to make up for the stinging defeat of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-polls earlier this month. With yesterday's Rajya Sabha wins across the country, the BJP will now be the single-largest party in the Upper House and hopeful of more parliamentary business being transacted. But the key takeaway from UP remains what Satish Mishra, key Mayawati aide, said post the results being announced: ""BJP proved that it is an anti-Dalit party, it prevented Bhim Rao Ambedkar from entering the Rajya Sabha by using money and muscle power. The BSP, SP and Congress alliance delivered"". So the tenuous alliance between the two regional heavyweights, which Shah and Yogi Adityanath correctly sense the danger of, remains intact. Instead of gloating over their hotly-contested victory last night, Adityanath publicity warned Mayawati about the ""treachery"" of the SP and how ""Yadav could never transfer votes to her"". Touching concern for a bitter rival, you might say, but also revelatory of the BJP's persistent migraine about the opposition alliance cutting in to UP's 80 seats and impeding the BJP's smooth return to Delhi. Last time around, the BJP managed 73 of the 80 seats in the state and Shah and Yogi are desperate for a re-run.  The public posturing after the results is the position the two rivals are going to take. Bua and Bhatija will milk ""Ambedkar's defeat at the hands of Aggarwal"" engineered by the BJP and the party's upper caste bent while underscoring that the BJP chose a Thakur, Adityanath, to head the state. In caste-obsessed UP, Yogi's supposed favouring of his caste in the administration is already becoming the stuff of legends in just a year of his government. The encounter spree he has unleashed is also upsetting the lower castes and Muslims who see it as an extra- constitutional assertion of caste hegemony. Adityanath has posted a large number of upper caste officials to let post, perhaps because of his lack of any administrative experience, and even the RSS has asked him to reset the delicate caste balance ahead of the general elections. A Shah-dictated cabinet reshuffle in UP is also on the cards to give more representation to lower castes. Yogi's warning to Mayawati was echoed by on-cue moaning from embedded analysts who claimed that Mayawati was ""upset"" that while her vote bank was transferable (in helping Akhilesh Yadav to win the Gorakhpur election, for example), he was not able to return the favour for her in the Rajya Sabha election. The BJP's social media army was trending hashtags all of last night to drive a wedge between the alliance partners. However, the reality is that the SP and Congress did manage to transfer all their second preference votes to Mayawati. She was let down by her own legislator, Anil Singh, who cross- voted, and the fact that her jailed legislator Mukhtar Ansari and SP's Hari Om Yadav could not vote. Further, Nitin Agrawal, an SP lawmaker whose father Naresh just defected to the BJP, voted for the BJP candidate. Mayawati's old enemy, don Raja Bhaiyya who she had jailed in 2003, kept his word to Yadav and voted for the SP but not the BSP. After voting, he also made a ""courtesy call"" to fellow Thakur Adityanath, reiterating the primacy of caste politics in UP.  So Shah's plans to ensure that the alliance hit the hump of defeat did not entirely work. The Congress, which has managed to hang on to a core voter base of 10 per cent in UP despite showing no electoral gains recently, has also now smoothly veered into the regional alliance. Mayawati has realised that allying with her old enemy, the SP, is the only way to take on the BJP. Yadav Junior has always been keen on the alliance and this time around even persuaded recalcitrant uncle Shiv Pal Yadav to get on board. The fractious feud in the Yadav family appears to have been buried, much to the misery of the BJP, which was assiduously fanning the flames of the rift. Two senior BJP leaders recently met Mulayam Singh and Shivpal to keep at this, but to no avail. The Congress perhaps surprised even itself with its deft management in Karnataka, Jharkhand, Bihar and UP and kept its flock together. No Congress MLA cross-voted despite many attempts at poaching, surely an indicator of the way the political wind is blowing. All three Congress candidates won in Karnataka where it got seven opposition members to cross vote for it. Shah knows that he demonstrated agile politics in snatching one extra Rajya Sabha seat in UP but it cannot be compared to the Gorakhpur debacle where the alliance showcased a strong political message. The fact that the BJP lost the parliamentary constituencies of Adityanath and his deputy, Keshav Prasad Maurya, is not lost on the UP electorate which still delights in political strongmen. The political score at half time is one all for Bua-Bhatija and the BJP. Look for things to get ugly.  © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."

How Far Government Has Gone To Dodge Nirav Modi Discussion,ndtv," Sections 72 A fortnight of parliament has been washed out and the government seems unmoved. The sale of coffee, tea and buttered toast in the canteen and in Central Hall has been brisk, but MPs have had to twiddle their thumbs every day, as both Houses have been adjourned. The ""North Korean channels"" may be blaming the opposition, but it is actually a clever government and its not-so-secret ally, the AIADMK, that have masterminded the disruption, leading to repeated adjournments. The banking swindle involving Nirav Modi and his friends is one of the biggest scandals in Indian history. Naturally, the opposition wants to discuss it. In the Rajya Sabha, we sought a discussion by invoking Rule 168, which is a voting rule. This means the discussion will be followed by a vote, which will decide if the House is satisfied by the government's response or not. The government refused to have a discussion under a voting rule. In the Lok Sabha, the opposition sought a similar discussion under a non-voting rule - no vote following the discussion. Again, the government refused. It didn't want a discussion in any circumstances. In the Lok Sabha, the Speaker strangely did not admit the no-confidence motion on the grounds that the House was not in order. As per the rules, it is the Speaker's obligation to ensure the House is in order. Or that there is enough order for the Speaker to be satisfied that 50 MPs back the motion. Rule 198 is clear on this: ""Once a no-confidence motion is moved, and the Speaker is of the opinion that the motion is proper (with regard to documentation), then she must read out the motion to the House."" Note the words ""must read out"". It doesn't give the presiding officer room for discretion. It is the government's responsibility to ensure the houses of parliament run. It needs to come up with a compromise formula, offer solutions. It has done nothing of the sort, and has not opened formal or informal dialogue with the opposition. It is simply not bothered. As I see it, the government is not interested in facing parliament till the elections of 2019. It is very likely that future sessions this year will also be disrupted with government connivance. This attitude is not recent. The BJP-led government has treated parliament with disdain. In the past four years, only nine of 72 legislative bills passed have been scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. The figure for UPA II (2009-14) was 66 out of 116. In 2017, parliament worked for just 57 days. This was lower than the annual average since 2000, which is 70 days. In fact, the record for 2017 tells an interesting story. As the government finished its priority work - and got its essential legislation through - it began to ignore and scuttle parliamentary proceedings. In the Budget Session in 2017, Question Hour worked for 108 per cent of its allotted time in the Lok Sabha and 86 per cent in the Rajya Sabha. This was impressive, but not indicative. In the Monsoon Session, these numbers fell to 67 per cent and 72 per cent. In the Winter Session (first week), they plummeted to 50 per cent (Lok Sabha) and 36 per cent (Rajya Sabha). And now, in 2018, parliament doesn't do business at all. The trend-line is clear There are many other examples. After the Railway Budget was merged with the Union Budget, there has been no separate discussion on the Railway component of the Budget and on Indian Railways. When issues related to the Railways are raised as part of the Budget discussion, the minister does not even respond. The Rajya Sabha is singled out for step-motherly treatment. All sorts of bills are introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha - where the BJP has a majority and pliant MPs - as money bills. The Rajya Sabha, as is well known, has very limited ability to influence money bills. Asked about this tactic, the Finance Minister once said, ""The wisdom of the [directly] elected House cannot be questioned by the Rajya Sabha."" What he meant was: the wisdom of the BJP cannot be questioned by parliament. We have seen that logic play out over the past fortnight. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018.

Dramatic Change In Perception Of BJP This Month - By Yashwant Sinha,ndtv," Sections 162 ""It never rains, it pours,"" thus goes the saying. It seems to apply aptly to the state in which the BJP and NDA find themselves today. The setback in Rajasthan where the BJP lost both the Lok Sabha seats of Alwar and Ajmer and the Vidhan Sabha seat of Mandalgarh for which by-elections were held in January as well as the loss in the two assembly by-elections held in Madhya Pradesh in February was more than made up for when the BJP swept the assembly elections in Tripura and was able to form coalition governments in Nagaland and Meghalaya. The victory in Tripura was particularly stunning because the BJP, almost non-existent so far, was able to win 35 out of the 59 seats. It appeared as if the horse of the BJP was unstoppable and it could conquer anyone anywhere. Despite some bickering, the NDA was also holding together and firmly. The by-elections for the two Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and one in Bihar again changed the perception of the invincibility of the BJP suddenly and dramatically. After all, the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat had been with the BJP since 1989; it was also the seat of Yogi Adityanath who had given it up on becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. He had won the seat five times, last by a margin of 3,53,647 votes. The other seat, Phulpur, had been won in 2014 by Keshav Prasad Maurya by a margin of 3,08,308 in 2014. Maurya is now the Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.  Nobody and absolutely nobody expected the BJP to lose Gorakhpur. There was some doubt about Phulpur - but even the most ardent supporter of the opposition was not prepared to predict the loss of Gorakhpur. Araria in Bihar had been won by Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal in 2014 and it succeeded in retaining it in the recent by-election. This three-nil loss in the Lok Sabha by-polls suddenly changed the perception of the people about the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections due in 2019. From a position of ""no challenge to the BJP in 2019"", the talk today is whether the BJP will be able to cross the 200 mark in the next Lok Sabha elections.  This dramatic change in perception has naturally had its impact on the NDA coalition. There is no doubt that the BJP treated its NDA partners shabbily. The BJP had won a majority of its own in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, yet it did not abandon its NDA partners after the election and magnanimously gave them a share in the union government. But it never forgot, not did it allow its allies to forget, that it had a majority of its own and that they were part of the government at its mercy. During the Vajpayee prime-ministership, allies were treated with due dignity and were heard and their point of view accommodated. Meetings with allies were held regularly and the BJP leadership reached out to them both collectively and individually. The BJP had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in a pre-poll coalition of 29 parties, the more important partners being the Shiv Sena, the Republican Party of India (Athvale) in Maharashtra, the Akali Dal in Punjab, the Apna Dal in UP, the Lok Janshakti Party of Ram Vilas Paswan and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party of  Upendra Kushwaha in Bihar, the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh. The JD(U) joined it subsequently after breaking its alliance with the RJD.  The Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has been uncomfortable with the BJP ever seen the two parties contested the assembly elections separately in 2014. They came together no doubt later to form a coalition government but the crack was always visible. In the media, the Shiv Sena plays the role of an opposition party both in Maharashtra as well as at the centre. Some of its statements are harsher than even the statements of BJP's arch opponents. But despite these differences, the two parties have held together both at the central and the state level. But for how long? The Sena has declared that it will not vote in favour of the government in case a no-confidence motion is taken up against it in the Lok Sabha. It appears that not only the Shiv Sena but all the other parties in the NDA are also unhappy with the way the BJP is treating them. The TDP with 16 MPs first withdrew its ministers from the government and then not only quit the NDA but has also now moved a motion of no-confidence against the government. The Akali Dal in Punjab has repeatedly expressed its unhappiness. Jitan Ram Manjhi, who joined the NDA has moved to the UPA. The 3-MP party of Upendra Kushwaha is flirting with the RJD in Bihar. Even Ram Vilas Paswan, whom Lalu Prasad Yadav once described as the best ""weather scientist"" of Indian politics (he knows which way the wind is blowing), has started to sermonize to the BJP. Om Prakash Rajbhar of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj party, who is also a minister in the UP government, threatened not to vote for the BJP candidate in the Rajya Sabha election. Many others are also fidgety.  Why is this happening? Why is the NDA unraveling? The reason is not far to seek. They all have sensed the mood of the people, which has decisively turned against the BJP. Instead of being an asset, the BJP may have become a liability of them. Nitish Kumar is the newest recruit to the NDA but his candidate suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the RJD in the recently held assembly by-poll in Jehanabad in Bihar. The unraveling in the NDA is another sign of the changing times. There is no doubt that the BJP will have some allies in the next Lok Sabha elections but the shape and size of that NDA is likely to be vastly different from its present shape. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018.

"In Karti Chidambaram Case, Indrani Mukerjea Brings Up Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram",ndtv," Sections | Reported by , Edited by | 430 Indrani Mukerjea, who once owned the television company at the heart of the CBI case against Karti Chidambaram, has told the Enforcement Directorate that she and Peter Mukerjea had met former Union Minister P Chidambaram to seek government approval to foreign investment proposals worth around Rs. 300 crore in the company INX Media. Ms Mukerjea's statement, also made separately to the CBI and recorded before a magistrate, has linked the former Union Finance Minister to the CBI case filed against Karti Chidambaram, 46. Karti Chidambaram, who was arrested on Wednesday morning, is accused of receiving kickbacks in 2007 to clear the foreign investment, using the influence of his father, who was then the Union finance minister. At the time, the company was owned by Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The couple has been in jail on charges of murdering her daughter Sheena Bora since 2015. NDTV has also accessed invoices that the investigating agencies said are proof of the payments made to Karti Chidambaram. Investigators said they got the invoices after they arrested Karti Chidambaram's chartered accountant two weeks ago. The former Union Minister and his son have denied the allegations, calling it a case of ""political vendetta"" and pointing that it was Mr Chidambaram, who as Finance Minister in 2013, had first ordered a probe by the Serious Frauds Office into allegations against the INX Group. Investigators told NDTV that Peter and Indrani Mukerjea had given statements to the Enforcement Directorate detailing their interactions with the former Union Minister and his son. Ms Mukerjea later, according to an official note, also ""confirmed payment of 7,00,000 dollars"" in her statement recorded before a magistrate. In their statements, Indrani Mukerjea and Peter Mukerjea say they had met P Chidambaram in his office in the North Block. They allege he had asked them to help the business of Karti Chidambaram and to ""make foreign remittances"" for this purpose. Subsequently, they met Karti Chidambaram at Delhi's Hyatt hotel, who allegedly demanded a payment of 1 million dollars. ""It was further admitted that Karti Chidambaram suggested the names of Chess Management and Advantage Strategic as alternatives to make payments,"" a document accessed by NDTV read. The CBI had filed a case against Karti Chidambaram last year, in which he has been accused of accepting bribes to the tune of 10 lakh. In court on Wednesday, Karti Chidambaram's lawyer, Congress lawmaker Abhishek Manu Singhvi, said he was being targeted because he was the senior Congress leader's son. Regarding the bribe allegation, Mr Singhvi said Karti Chidambaram was not a director or a shareholder of Advantage Strategic company, one of the companies through which the Mukerjeas had allegedly paid the bribe. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018.

Modi Government's Latest Move To Further North-South Divide - By Mihir Swarup Sharma,ndtv," Sections 4.6K Over the past week, I took one flight in to Bengaluru and one flight out. The flight in was from Heathrow, British Airways non-stop from London to Karnataka's capital. It had announcements in Kannada, besides English. The flight out was to Goa, on IndiGo. It had announcements in Hindi, besides English. If you think there is nothing odd and infuriating about this, then you must be from the Hindi belt. The young man next to me on the IndiGo flight, travelling from a Kannada-speaking state to a Konkani - and Portuguese-speaking state, had no idea what the announcements were saying. He didn't turn off his phone, for example, because he wasn't told he should. To top it all, the member of the cabin crew who came over to tell him to do so told him in Hindi (and rather brusquely). This systematic corporate idiocy would have been comic if not for the fact that the nice young man was embarrassed, upset and, I think, angered in consequence. To be from a non-Hindi state in today's India is to deal with a hundred little humiliations. Tweet from Bengaluru, as I did last week, and your location attached to the tweet will come up not in English or Kannada but in Hindi. That is Twitter India's demented conception of friendly and sensitive language policy, apparently. (A request for clarification on whether Twitter India would change this insane policy is still unheeded as I write this. Perhaps because I asked on Twitter, and who really feels like checking Twitter these days, not even Twitter itself.) That is the broader cultural and social context in which we must situate what appears to be a very technocratic dispute that has recently cropped up involving the southern states of the Union. MK Stalin, the leader of Tamil Nadu's opposition, has written a letter questioning the terms of reference of the Fifteenth Finance Commission - an issue that may seem unimportant but in fact is pivotal for India's future as a united and harmonious country. Stalin joins other state leaders - including Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, and Pawan Kalyan, the film star-turned-politician in Andhra Pradesh - in drawing attention to this apparently unimportant disagreement. What, you ask, could be at stake here? How could it be political enough to draw in three state leaders, and momentous enough to affect our destiny as a country? Well, Finance Commissions are a vitally important feature of our constitutional set-up. Every five years, the commission decides how tax revenue will be divided between various states (this is, of course, an even more important formula in the post-GST era). The more the commission's formula favours a particular state or set of states, the more money the state government gets from the national kitty to spend. One of the criteria used in this division is the state's share of the national population. This is natural, and as it should be. But the population shares used for this calculation have traditionally been frozen at the level determined by the 1971 census. The next finance commission, however, has been told by the Modi government to use the population shares of the 2011 census. And that's where the controversy comes in. Because in the decades between the 1971 and 2011 censuses, the share of the south (and of several other states) in India's population has declined. In other words, the Hindi heartland will, thanks to its abysmal failure to undertake family planning, get a larger share of taxes, thanks entirely to this one decision by the Modi government. It should thus be clear why this decision has the possibility of blowing up into becoming a major issue. Nor is it irrelevant that this decision has been taken by a government of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is almost entirely a party of the North and West - and, even more importantly, is seen as such in most of the rest of the country. North-South relations in India have been kept from boiling over for decades mainly thanks to careful compromises which are rarely talked about politically. One such is the decision to freeze the number of Lok Sabha seats given to each state for decades. This decision, taken in 2002, postpones redistributing constituencies across states till the 2030s. As a consequence, the southern states have more seats now than their population share would really suggest they should have. This careful compromise was a product of the coalition era, in which neither the Congress, then a truly pan-India party, nor the Vajpayee-era BJP and the various regional parties that depended on each other for power in New Delhi, felt it was useful or wise to politicise the consequences of divergent population growth. Today's politics is different. The BJP is now dominant in Hindi-speaking India; it seeks to expand into the regions dominated by its erstwhile partners. The incentives of all political players have thus changed. The BJP is happy to increase the domination of its political heartland. And the regional players will be happy to corner the BJP by pointing out its Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan character. Political bargaining is not always about fairness. But is there a question of fairness here as well? There are two competing arguments. Here is the first: we are all Indians, we should not be valued differently. A vote in UP should count for as much as a vote in Tamil Nadu. A poor person in Bihar is as deserving of government support as a poor person in Andhra Pradesh; her government should not be given less money for her welfare. That would be the consequence of ignoring the changes in population shares since 1971. Such injustice would tear the country apart. Here is the second: states and societies that have struggled and succeeded should be rewarded. As late as the 1950s, Kerala was a basket case. As late as the early 1990s, many of Andhra Pradesh's development indicators looked like Uttar Pradesh's. These states and their governments have worked hard to turn themselves around. Most importantly, they - along with others, like West Bengal - have invested in women's empowerment, and as a result they have declining total fertility. In other words, empowered women, like everywhere else in the world, are having fewer babies in these states. States like UP and Bihar have not done the hard work needed to improve development indicators, including empowering their women; thus they have a still-exploding population, even as the South and East see their populations decline. Rewarding states for failing is fundamentally unfair to those who have made sacrifices in the past. Such injustice would tear the country apart. The fundamental social and economic disconnect between the North/West and South/East will continue to grow. Soon, it will be expressed in moral terms, and take on greater political weight. When combined with the easy Hindi supremacism that comes so easily to companies, politicians, and intellectuals from the North, it will become explosive. There are few easy solutions to this; but whatever solution exists will emerge from reasonable discussion and compromise. Nobody in the North should dismiss , or as irrelevant, or stupid, or separatist, or as ""petty politics"". The danger lies in thinking that the unity of the Republic of India is not something that has to constantly be fought for. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."

BJP Puts The Squeeze On Nitish Kumar; The Pressure's Showing,ndtv," Sections 422 Nitish Kumar, the man once seen as a potential Third Front's Prime Minister remains a Chief Minister - and is at a historic low in his career. As the country heads towards the 2019 general election, the BJP is not inclined to give him too many seats in Bihar, arguing that he is not a vote-catcher anymore. Some of Bihar's BJP figures are suggesting that the number of seats given to Nitish's JD(U) should not cross into double digits (the state has 40 parliamentary seats). Nothing is of course certain, but the hard bargaining has already begun. That is why, after his defeat in the recent by-elections in Bihar, Nitish suddenly suggested that he never wanted to contest against Lalu Yadav's RJD in Jehanabad (assembly by-election), but did so only . Nitish could have refused (he is the Chief Minister after all) and presumably the BJP did not hold a gun to his head. In fact, well-placed sources say the JD(U) campaigned vigorously and hoped to defeat the RJD candidate as they presumed a combined vote-share with the BJP's would be adequate for the job. Instead, the RJD won Jehanabad by 35,000 votes in spite of chief Lalu Yadav being in jail. After the by-election results (where two of the three seats in Bihar were won by the RJD and one by the BJP), Nitish's conscience has suddenly resurfaced and he is also (yes, the same ones with whose support he now runs a government in Bihar). It's all rather sad for the man who had such a good governance record at one time and a promising career ahead. He is currently, in the words of a Bihar BJP MP, "" (belongs neither here nor there)."" The reason Nitish has begun to speak out is partly to give himself an alibi for the by-election defeat and partly because he is stuck in an alliance where the BJP now believes it is more powerful than the JD(U). The old seat-sharing understanding between the two parties that remained intact till the 2009 general election worked on the formula of the JD(U) contesting 25 seats and the BJP 15 (In 2004, it was 26 JD(U) and 14 BJP).  The script changed in 2014 as Nitish did not fight as part of the NDA having ended the alliance over it being led by Narendra Modi, whom he then viewed as an unacceptable and divisive figure. The JD(U) won just two Lok Sabha seats, the BJP with its allies (including Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP) won 31 seats, while RJD-Congress got seven. Subsequently, Nitish retrieved ground by fighting the 2015 assembly election with the RJD that always had a larger vote-share than the JD(U); Lalu's was also the party he had traditionally been in opposition to. The RJD-JD(U) sought a mandate against the BJP and won, but by late 2017, Nitish ditched the RJD to again form the government with the BJP. So many ideological contortions in the span of a few years have taken their toll and the balance that he maintained quite successfully for a decade is now gone. Nitish is clearly floundering: the recent by-elections were the first test of his standing on the ground after his political adventures (and misadventures) and he has come a cropper. The signs from the ground are ominous for him. In spite of always being an ally of the BJP, Nitish Kumar had till the 2010 assembly elections managed the feat of getting one-third of the minority vote in the state along with his carefully-crafted constituency among EBCs (Extremely Backward Castes) and a section of the Dalits. As his own Kurmi caste is not numerically strong, it's always been important for him to stich up rainbow social coalitions. That is now unravelling. The minorities this time have left him en bloc while the other social groups are also abandoning him. In Jehanabad, for instance, Dalits voted overwhelmingly for the RJD, partly because Jitan Ram Manjhi, a one-time member of the NDA, crossed over to the RJD. If the BJP continues to push Nitish, where can he go? If Lalu and Nitish could get together in 2015, it could happen again but seems unlikely after all the vitriol in the public space following Lalu going to jail and the emergence of his son Tejashwi as the main RJD campaigner. Nitish's best bet still remains in staying in the NDA but pointing out to the BJP that their voter blocs tend to be overwhelmingly upper caste. He does bring the facade of social justice and ""secularism"" to the alliance. This mattered in a state where Hindu-Muslim rifts, manufactured or real, have not been mined as successfully as in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.  Not that BJP leaders have not tried: a rash of communally-charged incidents and statements in the course of the by-elections and after the result are in the public domain. Which is also why Nitish is currently posturing on communalism. All he has to do is begin prosecuting the son of a prominent BJP leader, accused of inciting communal violence, and, for a change, put his money where his mouth is. If Nitish is to be believed any longer, he has to give people reason to trust him. In going against the popular mandate of 2015 and abandoning Lalu for the BJP, he breached the trust of the people of Bihar, whatever his reasons may have been. Nitish's stated reason for ditching the RJD was ""corruption"" while he had earlier walked out of the NDA because of ""communalism"". He is indeed between a rock and a hard place of his own making, and the ground beneath his feet is shrinking. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."

Saudi Arabia's Brash Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Takes His Show On The Road,ndtv," Sections | 12 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman arrived in Washington Monday for his first visit to the U.S. as presumptive heir to the throne. The trip comes at a crucial time in U.S.-Saudi relations, and a potential turning point in American policy toward the Middle East in general. But it is also telling that the visit won't be confined to Washington: ""MBS,"" as the prince is known, will also be visiting Boston, New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston. The time-span and breadth of travel is a strong indication of how much is at stake for the brash 32-year-old national leader, and how central Saudi Arabia's political and economic relationship with the U.S. is to his national, and personal, strategy. The list of policy imperatives is extensive, but MBS also knows that, first and foremost, he needs to polish his image in the U.S. He's been widely criticized as not merely brash and ambitious but impulsive and reckless by many American commentators. His personal efforts to counter this narrative began with a wide-ranging interview, aired on the eve of his arrival, with CBS's ""60 Minutes."" When discussing his reforms on women's rights, such as allowing driving, and promising new ""regulations ensuring equal pay for men and women,"" he bluntly admits that, despite his efforts, ""Saudi women still have not received their full rights."" Such outreach was important because the detention of some 100 prominent Saudi citizens at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton last year, ostensibly part of a corruption crackdown, was widely perceived as repressive and arbitrary. In addition, MBS, who also serves as defense minister, has been widely criticized for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is leading an intervention against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. In other words, the young prince has had some bad press, and he wants send a new message: that he is taking bold and decisive action because Saudi Arabia has no choice but to change quickly and radically -- and that this requires determined, no-nonsense leadership. But he also wants to appear thoughtful, realistic and progressive. MBS' most important meeting, of course, is Tuesday with President Donald Trump at the White House. But he's also due to spend time with many Cabinet secretaries and other administration honchos. If he's smart, he'll pay due attention to Congress, and to Democrats who may again hold crucial leadership positions following the November midterms. His Washington agenda will certainly include pushing forward a wide range of high-tech weapons purchases, most notably a $15 billion contract for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system. Given a series of missile attacks on Saudi cities launched from Yemen by the Houthis, many of which were said to have been intercepted by American-supplied defense systems, Saudi interest in this technology is stronger than ever. Both Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration insist that those missiles were provided to the Houthis by Iran, and coordinating policies toward Tehran will be high on the agenda. Beyond expanded American support for, and fending off criticism of, the war in Yemen, the Saudi and American teams will be hoping to forge common strategies on other regional hotspots where Iran is active, including Iraq and Syria. Washington and Riyadh have recently intensified pressure against Iran's client in Lebanon, Hezbollah, through sanctions and other means. But while they may share the broad goal of containing, and even rolling back, the expansion of Iran's influence in the Arab world, it's unclear how closely Riyadh and Washington are working together to achieve this. Indeed, one of MBS's most important goals must be to ascertain what, exactly, the Trump administration hopes to achieve in regional battlegrounds like Syria and how, precisely, Washington intends to accomplish it. Trump and his aides will almost certainly press MBS for a quick resolution of the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar, which Washington has come to regard as an unnecessary headache. Trump has made it clear he won't go to a summit with Gulf Arab leaders until they resolve their differences. But MBS may be happy to stick to this week's bilateral meetings for now, unless the American side can guarantee significant Qatari concessions to Saudi demands over ending support for Arab extremists and opposition groups, and curbing ties to Iran. A trickier question involves Saudi Arabia's nascent nuclear energy program. The country wants to build 16 reactors in the next couple of decades so its oil reserves can be largely devoted to export. Washington is asking Riyadh to agree to a ""123"" formula, whereby nonnuclear powers agreed to forgo uranium enrichment, plutonium reprocessing, and selling U.S. technology to others. But since Saudi Arabia will be largely mining its own uranium and has other potential suppliers -- and given that Iran still has the right to enrich even under the nuclear agreement -- Riyadh simply won't accept such terms. Reaching a compromise could help U.S. companies, including Westinghouse's bankruptcy issue, and bring the project under greater American supervision and away from any stealthy weapons component. It's a conundrum tailor-made for the art of the deal, if such a thing actually exists. The prince's social and economic reform program, much of which is included in his ""Vision 2030"" agenda, seeks to modernize Saudi Arabia in a generation. Shifting from an oil-based economy to a diverse one is one of his most ambitious projects, and it involves vastly increasing his country's infrastructure, technological and, especially, human capacity (including Saudi women). The partnership with U.S. is central to all three pillars, which is why MBS will spend so much time in so many cities in the coming days. In Seattle, MBS will be hosted by Bill Gates in a meeting that, along with San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Boston, will focus on technology. In Houston he will confer with energy industry honchos, and in New York City with financial industry and investment bigwigs. Perhaps his most intriguing stop is Los Angeles, the home of the entertainment industry. MBS is determined to introduce an element of public fun, heretofore banished to private spaces and in many cases forbidden outright in Saudi society. He just lifted a 35-year ban on cinemas, and unheard of mixed-gender public entertainments like concerts are cropping up around the country. He's the first Saudi ruler with a lot to discuss with Hollywood. The asks will flow in both directions. MBS is sure to be pressed on listing a proposed multibillion-dollar initial public offering for the state-own Saudi Aramco oil company on the New York Stock Exchange, rather than in London or another alternative. And Saudi Arabia has been urged by Washington to foot the bill for U.S. policies in Iraq and Syria that, among other things, counter Iran's influence. Few foreign leaders are this expansive in their U.S. outreach, because MBS has a focus not only on the diplomatic and military ties but also on investments, technology and even culture. It's potentially the beginning of a much closer era in U.S.-Saudi relations, but MBS has to persuade his hosts that his plan to transform his society rapidly can succeed.

When Vajpayee Summoned Sushma Swaraj And Me,ndtv," Sections 187 Both Houses of Parliament reconvened for the second part of the budget session on March 5, 2018. For three weeks now, disruptions have not allowed the Houses of Parliament to function at all. There was no discussion on the budget presented on February 1 this year. The demands for grants of selected ministries were not discussed and the Appropriation Bills and the Finance Bill were also passed without discussion. An important amendment of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act was surreptitiously introduced in the Finance Bill with retrospective effect going back to 1976 and was passed without members even noticing it. With the no-confidence motions already tabled by the Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress, nothing could be more soothing for the government than these daily disruptions. Everyone is aware of the cozy relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK whose leader Thambidurai is the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha and one of the leading disruptors of the House today. The Speaker has taken the view that she cannot put the no-confidence motions to the House if it is not in order and she cannot correctly count the number of members who may stand in its support. So for days on end, it has not been possible to take up this most important motion. The government remains supremely indifferent to the goings on and with the help of its captive media has succeeded in creating the impression that it is the opposition which is solely responsible for this state of affairs. There is no evidence of any attempt of the part of the government to reach out to the opposition parties specially at the senior-most levels. The Gujarat model has been adopted at the central level with a vengeance. I compare this with the respect that the great democrat and parliamentarian Atal Bihari Vajpayee had for Parliament when he was Prime Minister. There were disruptions then also and sometimes serious and prolonged disruptions. But keeping in mind the principle that the functioning of parliament was the direct responsibility of the government, senior ministers of the government always reached out to opposition parties and on the basis of some give and take via media was always worked out to end the logjam.  I especially recall the stalemate in our parliament which resulted from the American invasion of Iraq on March 20, 2003. The budget session of parliament was on and the Houses reconvened after the recess on April 7, 2003. The Congress and Left parties were up in arms against the US invasion. Their demand was that parliament should pass a resolution condemning the US action. As Minister for External Affairs, I was not in favor of the US aggression and the ministry had already expressed its ""deepest anguish"" at the commencement of military action in Iraq. But I was not in favour of a parliamentary resolution either. I had argued that the sentiment of parliament could be expressed through a discussion in both Houses and there was no need of a formal resolution. Discussions went on with the opposition parties in meetings convened by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha but a consensus eluded us. After a few days of continued disruptions, Vajpayee summoned Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and me and after listening to our report on the situation instructed us to find a way out. He clearly told us that he could not allow parliament to be stalemated in this fashion. Parliament must function he told us. We went back chastened. In the next meeting in the Speaker's chamber, we gave up our resistance to the passing of a resolution and started discussing the draft. A compromise was worked out after detailed deliberations and both sides agreed that instead of the word ""condemn"" for the US action, we should use the word ""deplore"". In Hindi we went a step further and used the word ""ninda"". The resolution was unanimously adopted by both Houses of Parliament after which they started functioning in an orderly manner once again. When in opposition, the BJP disrupted parliament almost regularly. The climax was reached when the entire winter session was wiped out in 2010 on the issue of the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the 2G scam. The UPA government obdurately resisted this demand for the entire duration of the session and therefore no consensus could emerge. Fortunately, good sense dawned on the ruling dispensation before the onset of the budget session, a compromise was reached between the two sides, and parliament started functioning normally. It must be clearly understood that the responsibility for the proper functioning of parliament is cast squarely on the government of the day. The opposition parties are entitled to use the forum of parliament to air their views through various rules which are provided in the rulebook. In our system, the government of the day is required to command a majority in Lok Sabha. It will lose power if it loses majority's in that House. The Lok Sabha rules provide for an adjournment motion and a motion of no-confidence. There is also a rule which provides for voting at the end of a discussion. The opposition is entitled to use these rules for moving such motions. It cannot be termed as an unreasonable demand. During the Vajpayee prime ministership, the government was required by the President of India to seek the confidence of the House once again in 1999. The Prime Minister moved a motion of confidence which was defeated in the Lok Sabha by one vote. The government resigned and fresh elections were held to elect a new Lok Sabha. In its second term, the government did not resist the opposition demand to move an adjournment motion on the UTI crisis in 2002 nor did it stand in the way of a no-confidence motion moved by the then leader of opposition Sonia Gandhi in 2003. Parliament is meant to pass legislation, transact financial business and discuss issues of public importance which the opposition demands. It must be allowed to perform all these functions. But to ensure this, it is important that there is understanding between the government and the opposition. Parliament can function smoothly only on the basis of consensus. Unfortunately, that consensus stands destroyed today. The government must take its share of blame. © Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2018. All rights reserved."
